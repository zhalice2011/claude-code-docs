# Migration guide

Guide for migrating to the latest Claude models from previous Claude versions

---

<Note>
  This guide covers migrating [Messages API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages) code. If you use [Claude Managed Agents](/docs/en/managed-agents/overview), no changes beyond updating the model name are required.
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Automate your migration with the Claude API skill.** In Claude Code, run `/claude-api migrate` to invoke the bundled [Claude API skill](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/claude-api-skill#migrating-to-a-newer-claude-model). It works for any target model on this page:

  ```text wrap
  /claude-api migrate this project to claude-opus-5
  ```

  The skill applies the model ID swap and, as needed, breaking parameter changes, prefill replacement, and effort calibration for your target model across your code base, then produces a checklist of items to verify manually. It asks you to confirm the migration scope (entire working directory, a subdirectory, or a specific file list) before editing any files. The skill also detects Amazon Bedrock and Claude Platform on AWS clients and adjusts model ID formats and feature changes for those platforms.

## Migrating to Claude Mythos 5 and Claude Fable 5

[Claude Fable 5](/docs/en/about-claude/models/introducing-claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5) is Anthropic's most capable widely released model, generally available on the Claude API, [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock), [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws), [Google Cloud](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai), and [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry). [Claude Mythos 5](https://anthropic.com/glasswing) shares the same capabilities and is offered in limited availability to approved customers in Project Glasswing.

The baseline settings shared by `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`:

* **Thinking:** [Adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) is always on. The model determines when and how much to think on each request, and no `thinking` configuration is required. Both `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` and manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) return a 400 error.
* **Prefill:** Prefilling the assistant message returns a 400 error. Use system prompt instructions instead.
* **Context window and output:** A [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) by default, and up to 128k output tokens per request.
* **Pricing:** $10 USD per million input tokens and $50 USD per million output tokens. See [Claude pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing).
* **Data retention:** Both models require 30-day data retention and are not available under zero data retention (ZDR) arrangements; both are designated Covered Models. On the Claude API, a request to Claude Fable 5 from an organization whose data retention configuration does not meet this requirement returns a 400 `invalid_request_error`. Organizations with a ZDR arrangement should contact their Anthropic account team to discuss data retention configuration. Alternatively, you can configure data retention per workspace. See [Model-specific data retention requirements](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention#model-specific-data-retention-requirements) for per-platform details.

Where the two models diverge:

* **Availability:** Claude Fable 5 is generally available. Claude Mythos 5 is available only to approved customers in [Project Glasswing](https://anthropic.com/glasswing).
* **Safety classifiers:** Claude Fable 5 runs safety classifiers that can decline requests with `stop_reason: "refusal"`. Claude Mythos 5 does not include these classifiers. See [Refusals and fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback).
* **Priority Tier:** [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) is supported on Claude Fable 5 but not on Claude Mythos 5.

### Migrating to Claude Mythos 5 and Claude Fable 5 from Claude Mythos Preview

[Claude Mythos 5](https://anthropic.com/glasswing) is the access-gated successor to [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing), the invitation-only research preview. [Claude Fable 5](/docs/en/about-claude/models/introducing-claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5) is the generally available model with the same capabilities, and the changes in this section apply equally to both targets.

Migration is mostly drop-in. Claude Mythos 5 and Claude Fable 5 use the same [Messages API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages) and the same [tool use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) patterns as Claude Mythos Preview, and token counts are roughly unchanged because all three models use the same tokenizer. The key changes to check are the features that are no longer available (listed in the next section) and thinking output. If you migrate to Claude Fable 5, also plan for safety classifier refusals, which Claude Mythos Preview and Claude Mythos 5 do not have; see [Refusals and fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback).

For the Claude Mythos Preview retirement timeline, see [Model deprecations](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations).

#### Update your model name

```python
model = "claude-mythos-preview"  # Before
model = "claude-mythos-5"  # After

# Or, for the generally available model with the same capabilities:
model = "claude-fable-5"  # After
```

#### Features not available on Claude Mythos 5 and Claude Fable 5

1. **Extended thinking and thinking token budgets:** Manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) is not supported on `claude-mythos-5` or `claude-fable-5` and returns a 400 error. [Adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) is always on: the model determines when and how much to think on each request, and no `thinking` configuration is required. `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` returns an error. `budget_tokens` has no direct replacement: thinking is adaptive, and the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) is a separate output-level control, not a thinking budget.

         messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
     )
     ```

     ```typescript TypeScript

     var parameters = new MessageCreateParams
     {
         Model = "claude-mythos-5",
         MaxTokens = 16000,
         Messages = [new() { Role = Role.User, Content = "..." }]
     };

     var response = await client.Messages.Create(parameters);
     Console.WriteLine(response);
     ```

         { role: "user", content: "..." }
       ]
     )
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   The change for Claude Fable 5 is identical, with `claude-fable-5` as the model name.

2. **Assistant prefill:** Prefilling the assistant message is not supported on `claude-mythos-5` or `claude-fable-5` and returns a 400 error, the same as on Claude Mythos Preview. Use system prompt instructions instead.

3. **Thinking output:** On `claude-mythos-5` and `claude-fable-5`, the raw chain of thought is never returned, but thinking blocks still carry readable summarized text when `thinking.display` is set to `summarized`. Pass thinking blocks back unchanged when continuing a conversation on the same model. See [Thinking output on Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking#thinking-output-on-claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5).

#### Token counting and billing

`claude-mythos-5` and `claude-fable-5` use the same tokenizer as `claude-mythos-preview` (the tokenizer introduced with Claude Opus 4.7). Token counts are roughly unchanged when migrating from `claude-mythos-preview`. Compared with models before Claude Opus 4.7, the same content can tokenize to roughly 30% more tokens, varying by content and workload shape.

[`/v1/messages/count_tokens`](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) returns roughly unchanged values for `claude-mythos-5` and `claude-fable-5` compared with `claude-mythos-preview`. Re-baseline cost and latency on your own workloads.

#### Migration checklist

* Update the model name from `claude-mythos-preview` to `claude-mythos-5`, or to `claude-fable-5` for the generally available model.
* Remove manual extended thinking configuration (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`). Adaptive thinking is always on, and no `thinking` field is required.
* Remove any `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` configuration. Disabling thinking returns an error on `claude-mythos-5` and `claude-fable-5`.
* Remove `budget_tokens`. It has no direct replacement: thinking is adaptive, and the `effort` parameter is a separate output-level control, not a thinking budget.
* Verify any code that parses the `thinking` field treats it as display text only and passes thinking blocks back unchanged when continuing on the same model. `thinking.display` defaults to `"omitted"` on `claude-mythos-5` and `claude-fable-5`, the same as on Claude Mythos Preview; set `display: "summarized"` to receive readable summaries. See [Thinking output on Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking#thinking-output-on-claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5).
* If you replay conversation history on another model, strip `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks from prior assistant turns first. Thinking blocks from `claude-mythos-5` and `claude-fable-5` are tied to the model that produced them, and models other than Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 silently ignore them. Stripping keeps cross-model requests minimal and uniform.
* If you migrate to Claude Fable 5, handle `stop_reason: "refusal"` and read the `stop_details.category` field. Claude Fable 5 runs safety classifiers that Claude Mythos Preview and Claude Mythos 5 do not have. See [Refusals and fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback).
* Re-baseline token counts and costs on your own workloads. Token counts are roughly unchanged when migrating from `claude-mythos-preview`.

### Migrating to Claude Mythos 5 and Claude Fable 5 from Claude Opus 5

Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 use the same [Messages API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages) and the same [tool use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) patterns as Claude Opus 5, with the same [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) by default and the same [128k max output tokens](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). The prefill and sampling-parameter restrictions, and the thinking display behavior, carry over from Claude Opus 5 unchanged. The changes to check are always-on thinking, pricing, Priority Tier, and data retention.

#### Update your model name

```python
model = "claude-opus-5"  # Before
model = "claude-fable-5"  # After

# Or, for the Project Glasswing model with the same capabilities:
model = "claude-mythos-5"  # After
```

#### What changed

1. **Thinking can no longer be disabled:** On Claude Opus 5, thinking is on by default and can be turned off with `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` at an [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) level of `high` or below. On `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`, [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) is always on, and `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` returns a 400 error at any effort level. Remove the `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` configuration and use lower effort levels to control token spend instead.

2. **Pricing:** Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 are priced at $10 USD per million input tokens and $50 USD per million output tokens, compared with $5 USD and $25 USD for Claude Opus 5. See [Claude pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing).

3. **Priority Tier:** [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) is not supported on Claude Opus 5, so no existing traffic is affected. If your organization has a Priority Tier commitment, Claude Fable 5 supports it; Claude Mythos 5 does not.

4. **Data retention:** Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 require 30-day data retention and are not available under zero data retention (ZDR) arrangements; both are designated Covered Models. See [Model-specific data retention requirements](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention#model-specific-data-retention-requirements).

#### Migration checklist

* Update the model name from `claude-opus-5` to `claude-fable-5` (or `claude-mythos-5`).
* Remove any `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` configuration; it returns a 400 error on `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`. Use lower [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) levels to control token spend instead, and revisit `max_tokens` for workloads that ran with thinking disabled on Claude Opus 5.
* If your organization has a zero data retention (ZDR) arrangement, confirm eligibility before migrating. See [Model-specific data retention requirements](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention#model-specific-data-retention-requirements).
* Re-baseline cost on your own workloads. Token counts are roughly unchanged; per-token pricing differs.

### Migrating to Claude Mythos 5 and Claude Fable 5 from Claude Opus 4.8

<Note>
  If your code is on Claude Opus 4.7 or earlier, first apply the relevant [Migrating to Claude Opus 5](#migrating-to-claude-opus-5) from-section for the API-level changes from your current model, then the remaining delta in this section.
</Note>

Migration is mostly drop-in. Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 use the same [Messages API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages) and the same [tool use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) patterns as Claude Opus 4.8, with the same [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) by default and the same [128k max output tokens](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). Token counts are roughly unchanged because the models use the same tokenizer. The key changes to check are always-on [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking), thinking output, safety classifier refusals (Claude Fable 5 only), and pricing.

#### Update your model name

```python
model = "claude-opus-4-8"  # Before
model = "claude-fable-5"  # After

# Or, for the Project Glasswing model with the same capabilities:
model = "claude-mythos-5"  # After
```

#### What changed

The items in this section describe the API and behavior differences worth checking after you swap the model ID. Except where noted, they apply equally to `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`.

1. **Adaptive thinking is always on:** [Adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) is the only thinking mode on `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`. The model determines when and how much to think on each request, and no `thinking` configuration is required. `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` returns an error. Use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to control thinking depth.

   The behavior change to check: on Claude Opus 4.8, requests without a `thinking` field run without thinking; on `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`, those same requests run with adaptive thinking. `max_tokens` remains a hard limit on total output, thinking plus response text, so revisit it for workloads that ran without thinking on Claude Opus 4.8. See [Cost control](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking-steering-and-cost#cost-control).

       ]
     )
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   The change for Claude Mythos 5 is identical, with `claude-mythos-5` as the model name.

2. **Extended thinking and thinking budgets (unchanged):** Manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) is not supported on `claude-fable-5` or `claude-mythos-5` and returns a 400 error, the same as on Claude Opus 4.8. `budget_tokens` has no direct replacement: thinking is adaptive, and the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) is a separate output-level control, not a thinking budget.

3. **Assistant prefill (unchanged):** Prefilling the assistant message is not supported on `claude-fable-5` or `claude-mythos-5` and returns a 400 error, the same as on Claude Opus 4.8. Use system prompt instructions instead.

4. **Thinking output:** On `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`, the raw chain of thought is never returned, but thinking blocks still carry readable summarized text when `thinking.display` is set to `summarized`. Pass thinking blocks back unchanged when continuing a conversation on the same model. See [Thinking output on Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking#thinking-output-on-claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5).

5. **Safety classifiers and the `refusal` stop reason (Claude Fable 5 only):** `claude-fable-5` runs safety classifiers on requests and during response generation. Claude Mythos 5 does not include these classifiers. When a classifier declines a request, the Messages API returns `stop_reason: "refusal"` as a successful HTTP 200 response, not an error. The `stop_details.category` field reports which classifier fired, with categories such as `"cyber"`, `"bio"`, and `"reasoning_extraction"`, or `null` when the refusal maps to no named category. See the [refusal category table](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback#refusal-response) for the full set.

   You are not billed for the input tokens of a request refused before any output is generated. When a classifier fires mid-stream, the input and already-streamed output are billed; discard the partial output.

   To re-run refused requests on another model automatically, pass the opt-in `fallbacks` parameter, which is in beta on the Claude API. The parameter is not available on the Message Batches API or on Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Foundry; on those three platforms, run the retry client-side or use the SDK refusal-fallback middleware. See [Refusals and fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback).

6. **Start at `high` effort:** The [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) default remains `high`. On Claude Opus 4.8, the recommendation for coding and high-autonomy work is to set `xhigh` explicitly. On `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`, use `high` as the default for most tasks and reserve `xhigh` for the most capability-sensitive workloads. Lower effort settings still perform well and often exceed `xhigh` performance on prior models. Reduce effort if a task completes but takes longer than necessary. See [Prompting Claude Fable 5](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-fable-5#consider-all-effort-levels).

7. **Lower prompt caching minimum:** The minimum cacheable prompt length on `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5` is 512 tokens, lower than the 1,024 tokens on Claude Opus 4.8. Prompts that were too short to cache on Claude Opus 4.8 can now create cache entries, with no code changes required. See [Prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#cache-limitations) for per-model minimums.

#### Migration checklist

* If your organization has a zero data retention (ZDR) arrangement, confirm eligibility before migrating. `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5` require 30-day data retention; on the Claude API, requests to `claude-fable-5` that do not meet this requirement return a 400 `invalid_request_error`. Claude Opus 4.8 remains available under ZDR. See [Model-specific data retention requirements](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention#model-specific-data-retention-requirements).
* Update the model name from `claude-opus-4-8` to `claude-fable-5` (or `claude-mythos-5`).
* Remove any `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` configuration. Disabling thinking returns an error on `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`, and requests without a `thinking` field run with adaptive thinking.
* If you removed manual extended thinking and assistant prefills during earlier migrations, no action is needed: both remain unsupported on `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`.
* Verify any code that parses the `thinking` field treats it as display text only and passes thinking blocks back unchanged when continuing on the same model. `thinking.display` defaults to `"omitted"` on `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5`, the same as on Claude Opus 4.8; set `display: "summarized"` to receive readable summaries. See [Thinking output on Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking#thinking-output-on-claude-fable-5-and-claude-mythos-5).
* If you replay conversation history on another model, strip `thinking` and `redacted_thinking` blocks from prior assistant turns first. Thinking blocks from `claude-fable-5` and `claude-mythos-5` are tied to the model that produced them, and models other than Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 silently ignore them. Stripping keeps cross-model requests minimal and uniform. The exception is redeeming a [fallback credit](/docs/en/build-with-claude/fallback-credit), which requires the request body echoed under that feature's exact rules.
* If you migrate to Claude Fable 5, handle `stop_reason: "refusal"` and read the `stop_details.category` field. To re-run refused requests on another model automatically, consider the opt-in `fallbacks` parameter (beta). See [Refusals and fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback).
* Re-evaluate your `effort` setting. Start at `high` for most tasks, including workloads that ran at `xhigh` on Claude Opus 4.8.
* Re-baseline cost and latency on your own workloads. Token counts are roughly unchanged when migrating from `claude-opus-4-8`; per-token pricing differs.

## Migrating to Claude Opus 5

Claude Opus 5 is a step-change improvement over Claude Opus 4.8, strong on deep reasoning, agentic and long-horizon tasks, and test-time compute scaling. For behavioral differences and model-specific prompting patterns, see [Prompting Claude Opus 5](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5).

Claude Opus 5 is a drop-in upgrade for Claude Opus 4.8 at the same pricing of $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens; see [Claude pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing). There are two breaking changes for code already running on Claude Opus 4.8, covered under Breaking changes below. Claude Opus 5 supports the same set of features as Claude Opus 4.8, including the [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) (the default, with no beta header), [128k max output tokens](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview), [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking), [prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching), [batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing), the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files), [PDF support](/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support), [vision](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision), and server-side and client-side [tools](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview), with two exceptions: [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) is not available on Claude Opus 5, and [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) is not supported on Claude Opus 5. See each tool page for model availability.

### Migrating to Claude Opus 5 from Claude Opus 4.8

<Note>
  This section covers the delta from Claude Opus 4.8 only. If your code is on Claude Opus 4.7 or earlier, use the sections below instead: [Migrating to Claude Opus 5 from Claude Opus 4.7](#migrating-from-claude-opus-47) or [Migrating to Claude Opus 5 from Claude Opus 4.6 and earlier Opus models](#migrating-from-claude-opus-46). They include this delta plus the breaking changes from earlier models (sampling parameters rejected, manual extended thinking rejected, prefill removed, new tokenizer).
</Note>

#### Update your model name

```python
# Opus migration
model = "claude-opus-4-8"  # Before
model = "claude-opus-5"  # After
```

`claude-opus-5` is a fixed model ID with no date suffix, the same scheme as `claude-opus-4-8` and `claude-sonnet-5`.

#### Breaking changes

1. **Thinking on by default:** On Claude Opus 4.8, requests without a `thinking` field run without thinking; on Claude Opus 5, the same requests run with [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking). `max_tokens` remains a hard limit on total output, thinking plus response text, so revisit it for workloads that ran without thinking on Claude Opus 4.8. To preserve the old behavior, pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}`, subject to the effort cap in the next item; note that with thinking disabled the model can occasionally emit tool calls as plain text or include internal XML tags in its visible output, so prefer lower effort levels with thinking enabled where you can, and see [Running with thinking disabled](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#running-with-thinking-disabled) for mitigations where you can't.

2. **Disabling thinking is capped at `high` effort:** You can still turn thinking off with `thinking: {type: "disabled"}`, but only at an [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) level of `high` or below. A request that combines `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` with effort `xhigh` or `max` returns a 400 error. Claude Opus 4.8 accepts this combination, so audit requests that disable thinking before you migrate.

   The check is enforced on each request: every request's effort and thinking configuration is validated independently, so a request that raises effort to `xhigh` or `max` while thinking is disabled is rejected even if earlier requests in the conversation were accepted.

   Before (accepted on Claude Opus 4.8, rejected on Claude Opus 5):

   ```python
   client.messages.create(
       model="claude-opus-4-8",
       max_tokens=16000,
       thinking={"type": "disabled"},
       output_config={"effort": "xhigh"},
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
   )
   ```

   After (Claude Opus 5), either remove the `thinking` field to re-enable thinking:

   ```python
   client.messages.create(
       model="claude-opus-5",
       max_tokens=16000,
       output_config={"effort": "xhigh"},  # thinking is on by default
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
   )
   ```

   or keep thinking disabled and lower the effort:

   ```python
   client.messages.create(
       model="claude-opus-5",
       max_tokens=16000,
       thinking={"type": "disabled"},
       output_config={"effort": "high"},  # or "medium", "low"
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
   )
   ```

#### Recommended changes

These are not required but will improve your experience:

1. **Test `max` effort for capability-critical work:** Claude Opus 5 supports the full set of [effort levels](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`). Where maximum capability matters more than token spend, test `max` effort. It can deliver gains on the most demanding tasks but may show diminishing returns from increased token usage and can be prone to overthinking on simpler ones. If you run at `xhigh` or `max` effort, set a large `max_tokens` so the model has room to think and act; start at 64k tokens and tune from there.

2. **Consider automatic fallbacks:** Claude Opus 5 ships with cybersecurity safety classifiers whose cyber-category refusals can fall back to Claude Opus 4.8. To re-run refused requests on another model automatically, consider the `fallbacks` parameter with the `"default"` mode (`fallbacks: "default"`), which selects a recommended fallback model based on the refusal category instead of a hand-maintained model list. The `"default"` mode is in beta and requires the `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01` beta header. See [Refusals and fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback).

3. **Cache shorter prompts:** The minimum cacheable prompt length on Claude Opus 5 is 512 tokens, down from 1,024 tokens on Claude Opus 4.8. Prompts that were too short to cache on Claude Opus 4.8 can now create cache entries, with no code changes required. See [Prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#cache-limitations) for per-model minimums.

4. **Change tools mid-conversation (beta):** You can add or remove tools between turns of a conversation without invalidating [prompt cache](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) hits on earlier turns. Send the beta header `mid-conversation-tool-changes-2026-07-01`. This is useful for agentic workloads that expose tools progressively or retire them as a task advances; without it, a changed tool list invalidates the cached prefix.

5. **Re-tune length and verbosity prompts:** Default visible responses and written deliverables run longer on Claude Opus 5 than on Claude Opus 4.8, and lowering effort reduces thinking volume without reliably shortening the visible response. Prompt explicitly for conciseness or a target length instead. See [Response length and verbosity](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#response-length-and-verbosity) and [Written deliverable length](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#written-deliverable-length).

6. **Remove carried-over verification instructions and constrain scope:** Claude Opus 5 verifies its own work without being told to, so remove explicit verification or self-check instructions carried over from prompts tuned for earlier models; leaving them in causes over-verification. For narrow tasks, constrain the task scope explicitly. In multi-agent frameworks, give explicit guidance on which scenarios warrant delegation or cap the number of subagents, because Claude Opus 5 delegates more readily than earlier models. See [Task scope and over-verification](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#task-scope-and-over-verification) and [Controlling subagent spawning](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#controlling-subagent-spawning).

#### Migration checklist

* Update the model name from `claude-opus-4-8` to `claude-opus-5`.
* Review workloads that ran without a `thinking` field: they run with thinking on Claude Opus 5. Revisit `max_tokens`, which remains a hard limit on total output (thinking plus response text), or pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` at effort `high` or below to preserve the old behavior. If you disable thinking, review [Running with thinking disabled](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#running-with-thinking-disabled) for the output artifacts that can appear and their prompting mitigations.
* Audit requests that disable thinking: `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` with effort `xhigh` or `max` returns a 400 error, enforced on each request. Re-enable thinking or lower the effort to `high` or below.
* Re-evaluate your `effort` setting: run a fresh [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) sweep on your own evals rather than carrying over a setting tuned for an earlier model. `low` and `medium` effort are stronger on Claude Opus 5 than on earlier Opus models and are worth testing as cost and latency controls, and test `max` effort where maximum capability matters more than token spend. If you run at `xhigh` or `max` effort, raise `max_tokens` to at least 64k as a starting point.
* Review prompts near the caching minimum: prompts of 512 tokens or more can now create cache entries, down from 1,024 tokens on Claude Opus 4.8.
* Handle `stop_reason: "refusal"`, and consider `fallbacks: "default"` to re-run refused requests on a recommended fallback model automatically.
* If your organization has a [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) commitment, plan capacity separately: Priority Tier is not supported on Claude Opus 5, while Claude Opus 4.8 keeps it.
* For agentic workloads, consider [task budgets](/docs/en/build-with-claude/task-budgets) (beta) and mid-conversation tool changes (beta).
* Re-tune length and verbosity prompts: default visible responses and written deliverables run longer on Claude Opus 5, and lowering effort reduces thinking volume without reliably shortening the visible response. Prompt explicitly for conciseness or a target length. See [Response length and verbosity](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#response-length-and-verbosity) and [Written deliverable length](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#written-deliverable-length).
* Remove verification and self-check instructions carried over from prompts tuned for earlier models (they cause over-verification on Claude Opus 5), constrain task scope explicitly for narrow tasks, and in multi-agent frameworks steer or cap subagent delegation. See [Task scope and over-verification](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#task-scope-and-over-verification) and [Controlling subagent spawning](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#controlling-subagent-spawning).
* Re-baseline cost and latency on your own workloads.

### Migrating to Claude Opus 5 from Claude Opus 4.7

Claude Opus 5 should have strong out-of-the-box performance on existing Claude Opus 4.7 prompts and evals, at the same pricing of $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens. It supports the same set of features as Claude Opus 4.7, including the [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows), [128k max output tokens](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview), [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking), [prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching), [batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing), the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files), [PDF support](/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support), [vision](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision), and server-side and client-side [tools](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview), with two exceptions: [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) is not available on Claude Opus 5, and [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) is not supported on Claude Opus 5. It also adds [mid-conversation system messages](/docs/en/build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages) and publicly documents [refusal stop details](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback#refusal-response).

<Note>
  If your code is on Claude Opus 4.6 or earlier, use [Migrating to Claude Opus 5 from Claude Opus 4.6 and earlier Opus models](#migrating-from-claude-opus-46) instead. That section includes breaking changes (sampling parameters rejected, manual extended thinking rejected, new tokenizer) that the upgrade from Claude Opus 4.7 alone does not cover.
</Note>

#### Update your model name

```python
# Opus migration
model = "claude-opus-4-7"  # Before
model = "claude-opus-5"  # After
```

#### Breaking changes

1. **Thinking on by default:** On Claude Opus 4.7, requests without a `thinking` field run without thinking; on Claude Opus 5, the same requests run with [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking). `max_tokens` remains a hard limit on total output, thinking plus response text, so revisit it for workloads that ran without thinking on Claude Opus 4.7. To preserve the old behavior, pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}`, subject to the effort cap in the next item; note that with thinking disabled the model can occasionally emit tool calls as plain text or include internal XML tags in its visible output, so prefer lower effort levels with thinking enabled where you can, and see [Running with thinking disabled](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#running-with-thinking-disabled) for mitigations where you can't.

2. **Disabling thinking is capped at `high` effort:** You can turn thinking off with `thinking: {type: "disabled"}`, but only at an [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) level of `high` or below. A request that combines `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` with effort `xhigh` or `max` returns a 400 error. Claude Opus 4.7 accepts this combination, so audit requests that disable thinking before you migrate.

   The check is enforced on each request: every request's effort and thinking configuration is validated independently, so a request that raises effort to `xhigh` or `max` while thinking is disabled is rejected even if earlier requests in the conversation were accepted.

   Before (accepted on Claude Opus 4.7, rejected on Claude Opus 5):

   ```python
   client.messages.create(
       model="claude-opus-4-7",
       max_tokens=16000,
       thinking={"type": "disabled"},
       output_config={"effort": "xhigh"},
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
   )
   ```

   After (Claude Opus 5), either remove the `thinking` field to run with thinking:

   ```python
   client.messages.create(
       model="claude-opus-5",
       max_tokens=16000,
       output_config={"effort": "xhigh"},  # thinking is on by default
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
   )
   ```

   or keep thinking disabled and lower the effort:

   ```python
   client.messages.create(
       model="claude-opus-5",
       max_tokens=16000,
       thinking={"type": "disabled"},
       output_config={"effort": "high"},  # or "medium", "low"
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
   )
   ```

#### What changed

The following items are not breaking changes; they describe behavior differences worth checking after you swap the model ID.

1. **Sampling parameters (unchanged):** Setting `temperature`, `top_p`, or `top_k` to a non-default value returns a 400 error on Claude Opus 5, the same as on Claude Opus 4.7. The SDK request types still define these fields for compatibility with earlier models, so code that sets them type-checks, but the API rejects the request server-side. If you removed these parameters when migrating to Opus 4.7, no further changes are needed.

2. **Effort default is `high`:** The [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) default on Claude Opus 5 is `high` on the Claude API and Claude Code. If you already set effort explicitly, your setting is unchanged.

3. **Effort levels recalibrated:** The token allocation behind each effort level changes on Claude Opus 5 compared to Claude Opus 4.7, and Claude Opus 5 supports the full set of effort levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`). Run a fresh effort sweep on your own evals rather than carrying over a setting tuned for Claude Opus 4.7. `low` and `medium` effort are stronger on Claude Opus 5 than on earlier Opus models and are worth testing as cost and latency controls, and test `max` effort where maximum capability matters more than token spend. If you run at `xhigh` or `max` effort, set a large `max_tokens` so the model has room to think and act; start at 64k tokens and tune from there. See [Effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort).

4. **1M context window is the default:** Claude Opus 5 serves the full 1M token [context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) by default with no beta header and no long-context premium. If your client passes a context-window beta header for compatibility with older models, you can remove it on Claude Opus 5.

5. **Mid-conversation system messages:** Claude Opus 5 accepts `role: "system"` messages immediately after a user turn in the `messages` array (subject to [placement rules](/docs/en/build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages#limitations)). Use the top-level `system` field for instructions that apply from the start. Claude Opus 4.7 rejects `role: "system"` in `messages` with a 400 error. If you maintain code paths that rebuild the full message history to update instructions, you can simplify them and preserve [prompt cache](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) hits on earlier turns.

6. **Refusal stop details:** The `stop_details` object on refusal responses (available since Claude Opus 4.7) is now publicly documented. When the model declines a request, it identifies the category of refusal, in addition to the existing `refusal` stop reason. No beta header is required, and there is no opt-out. See [Handling stop reasons](/docs/en/build-with-claude/handling-stop-reasons).

7. **Lower prompt caching minimum:** The minimum cacheable prompt length on Claude Opus 5 is 512 tokens, lower than on Claude Opus 4.7. Prompts that were too short to cache on Claude Opus 4.7 can now create cache entries, with no code changes required. See [Prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#cache-limitations) for per-model minimums.

#### Recommended changes

These are not required but will improve your experience:

1. **Consider automatic fallbacks:** Claude Opus 5 ships with cybersecurity safety classifiers whose cyber-category refusals can fall back to Claude Opus 4.8. To re-run refused requests on another model automatically, consider the `fallbacks` parameter with the `"default"` mode (`fallbacks: "default"`), which selects a recommended fallback model based on the refusal category instead of a hand-maintained model list. The `"default"` mode is in beta and requires the `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01` beta header. See [Refusals and fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback).

2. **Change tools mid-conversation (beta):** You can add or remove tools between turns of a conversation without invalidating [prompt cache](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) hits on earlier turns. Send the beta header `mid-conversation-tool-changes-2026-07-01`. This is useful for agentic workloads that expose tools progressively or retire them as a task advances; without it, a changed tool list invalidates the cached prefix.

3. **Re-tune length and verbosity prompts:** Default visible responses and written deliverables run longer on Claude Opus 5 than on earlier Opus models, and lowering effort reduces thinking volume without reliably shortening the visible response. Prompt explicitly for conciseness or a target length instead. See [Response length and verbosity](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#response-length-and-verbosity) and [Written deliverable length](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#written-deliverable-length).

4. **Remove carried-over verification instructions and constrain scope:** Claude Opus 5 verifies its own work without being told to, so remove explicit verification or self-check instructions carried over from prompts tuned for earlier models; leaving them in causes over-verification. For narrow tasks, constrain the task scope explicitly. In multi-agent frameworks, give explicit guidance on which scenarios warrant delegation or cap the number of subagents, because Claude Opus 5 delegates more readily than earlier models. See [Task scope and over-verification](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#task-scope-and-over-verification) and [Controlling subagent spawning](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#controlling-subagent-spawning).

#### Migration checklist

* Update model name from `claude-opus-4-7` to `claude-opus-5` (or update aliases).
* Review workloads that ran without a `thinking` field: they run with thinking on Claude Opus 5. Revisit `max_tokens`, which remains a hard limit on total output (thinking plus response text), or pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` at effort `high` or below to preserve the old behavior. If you disable thinking, review [Running with thinking disabled](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#running-with-thinking-disabled) for the output artifacts that can appear and their prompting mitigations.
* Audit requests that disable thinking: `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` with effort `xhigh` or `max` returns a 400 error, enforced on each request. Re-enable thinking or lower the effort to `high` or below.
* If you removed sampling parameters during the Opus 4.7 migration, no action is needed. If you re-added them with a 400-retry path, remove that retry path.
* Re-evaluate your `effort` setting: run a fresh [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) sweep on your own evals rather than carrying over a setting tuned for Claude Opus 4.7. `low` and `medium` effort are stronger on Claude Opus 5 than on earlier Opus models, and test `max` effort where maximum capability matters more than token spend. If you run at `xhigh` or `max` effort, raise `max_tokens` to at least 64k as a starting point.
* Remove any context-window beta header. The 1M context window is the default on the Claude API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Foundry.
* If you rebuild conversation history to update instructions, consider switching to a mid-conversation system message to preserve prompt cache hits.
* Verify your stop-reason handling reads `stop_details` on refusals (available since Claude Opus 4.7; now publicly documented), and consider `fallbacks: "default"` to re-run refused requests on a recommended fallback model automatically.
* Review prompts near the caching minimum: prompts of 512 tokens or more can now create cache entries.
* If you use [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool), plan an alternative: it is not available on Claude Opus 5.
* If your organization has a [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) commitment, note that Priority Tier is not supported on Claude Opus 5.
* For agentic workloads, consider [task budgets](/docs/en/build-with-claude/task-budgets) (beta) and mid-conversation tool changes (beta).
* Re-tune length and verbosity prompts, and remove verification and self-check instructions carried over from prompts tuned for earlier models.
* Re-baseline cost and latency at your chosen effort level.

### Migrating to Claude Opus 5 from Claude Opus 4.6 and earlier Opus models

Claude Opus 5 should have strong out-of-the-box performance on existing Claude Opus 4.6 prompts and evals at the same pricing, but there are a handful of behavioral and API changes worth knowing about as you migrate. Most of these changes took effect in Claude Opus 4.7; two more, thinking on by default and an effort cap on disabling thinking, take effect on Claude Opus 5. All of them are covered below, so this section is complete for code coming straight from Claude Opus 4.6. Claude Opus 5 supports the same set of features as Claude Opus 4.6, including:

* [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) at standard API pricing with no long-context premium
* [128k max output tokens](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview)
* [Adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking)
* [Prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)
* [Batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)
* [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files)
* [PDF support](/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support)
* [Vision](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision)
* Server-side and client-side [tools](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) ([bash](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/bash-tool), [code execution](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool), [computer use](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool), [text editor](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool), [web search](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool), [MCP connector](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector), [memory](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/memory-tool))

Two exceptions: [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) is not available on Claude Opus 5, and [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) is not supported on Claude Opus 5.

#### Update your model name

```python
# Opus migration
model = "claude-opus-4-6"  # Before
model = "claude-opus-5"  # After
```

#### Breaking changes

1. **Extended thinking removed:** `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` is no longer supported on Claude Opus 4.7 or later models and returns a 400 error. Switch to [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) (`thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`) and use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to control thinking depth. On Claude Opus 5, adaptive thinking is **on by default**: `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` is valid and equivalent to omitting the `thinking` field entirely (see the next item).

   </CodeGroup>

   Adaptive thinking is steerable through prompting and the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort); see [Choosing an effort level](#choosing-an-effort-level).

2. **Thinking on by default:** On Claude Opus 4.6 and Claude Opus 4.7, requests without a `thinking` field run without thinking; on Claude Opus 5, the same requests run with [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking). `max_tokens` remains a hard limit on total output, thinking plus response text, so revisit it for workloads that ran without thinking. To preserve the old behavior, pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}`, subject to the effort cap in the next item; note that with thinking disabled the model can occasionally emit tool calls as plain text or include internal XML tags in its visible output, so prefer lower effort levels with thinking enabled where you can, and see [Running with thinking disabled](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#running-with-thinking-disabled) for mitigations where you can't.

3. **Disabling thinking is capped at `high` effort:** You can turn thinking off with `thinking: {type: "disabled"}`, but only at an [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) level of `high` or below. A request that combines `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` with effort `xhigh` or `max` returns a 400 error on Claude Opus 5, enforced on each request. Audit requests that disable thinking before you migrate: re-enable thinking or lower the effort to `high` or below.

4. **Sampling parameters removed:** Setting `temperature`, `top_p`, or `top_k` to any non-default value on Claude Opus 4.7 or later models, including Claude Opus 5, returns a 400 error. The safest migration path is to omit these parameters entirely from request payloads. Prompting is the recommended way to guide model behavior on Claude Opus 5. If you were using `temperature = 0` for determinism, note that it never guaranteed identical outputs on prior models.

5. **Thinking content omitted by default:** Thinking blocks still appear in the response stream on Claude Opus 4.7 and later models, but their `thinking` field is empty unless you explicitly opt in. This is a silent change from Claude Opus 4.6, where the default was to return summarized thinking text. To restore summarized thinking content, set `thinking.display` to `"summarized"`:

   <CodeGroup exclude="shell">
     ```python Python
     thinking = {
         "type": "adaptive",

     ```typescript TypeScript
     const thinking = {
       type: "adaptive",
       display: "summarized"
     };
     ```

     var thinking = new ThinkingConfigAdaptive { Display = Display.Summarized };
     ```

     ```go Go
     thinking := anthropic.ThinkingConfigParamUnion{
     	OfAdaptive: &anthropic.ThinkingConfigAdaptiveParam{
     		Display: anthropic.ThinkingConfigAdaptiveDisplaySummarized,
     	},
     }
     ```

     ```java Java
     ThinkingConfigAdaptive thinking = ThinkingConfigAdaptive.builder()
         .display(ThinkingConfigAdaptive.Display.SUMMARIZED)
         .build();
     ```

     ```php PHP
     $thinking = ['type' => 'adaptive', 'display' => 'summarized'];
     ```

     ```ruby Ruby
     thinking = {
       type: "adaptive",
       display: "summarized"
     }
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   The default is `"omitted"` on Claude Opus 4.7 and later models. If your product streams reasoning to users, the new default appears as a long pause before output begins; set `display: "summarized"` to restore visible progress during thinking. See [Controlling thinking display](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking#controlling-thinking-display) for details.

6. **Updated token counting:** Claude Opus 4.7 introduced a new tokenizer, which later Opus models, including Claude Opus 5, also use. It contributes to improved performance on a wide range of tasks, and it may use roughly 1x to 1.35x as many tokens when processing text compared to models before Claude Opus 4.7 (up to \~35% more, varying by content).

   [`/v1/messages/count_tokens`](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) returns a different number of tokens for Claude Opus 5 than it did for Claude Opus 4.6. Token efficiency can vary by workload shape.

   Prompting interventions, `task_budget`, and `effort` can help control costs and ensure appropriate token usage. These controls may trade off model intelligence. Update your `max_tokens` parameters to give additional headroom, including compaction triggers. Claude Opus 5 provides a 1M context window at standard API pricing with no long-context premium.

7. **Prefill removal (carried over from Opus 4.6):** Prefilling assistant messages returns a 400 error on Claude Opus 4.7 and later models, including Claude Opus 5. Use [structured outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs), system prompt instructions, or `output_config.format` instead.

#### Choosing an effort level

The [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) allows you to tune Claude's intelligence versus token spend, trading off capability for faster speed and lower costs. Claude Opus 5 supports the full set of effort levels and defaults to `high`. Run a fresh effort sweep on your own evals rather than carrying over a setting tuned for an earlier model:

* **`max`:** Can deliver gains on the most demanding tasks but may show diminishing returns from increased token usage and can be prone to overthinking on simpler ones. Test it where maximum capability matters more than token spend.
* **`xhigh`:** Extended capability for long-running agentic and coding work that needs more depth than the default.
* **`high`:** The default. Balances token usage and intelligence for most tasks.
* **`medium`:** Cost-saving step-down from the default. Stronger on Claude Opus 5 than on earlier Opus models and worth testing as a cost and latency control.
* **`low`:** Most efficient. Reserve for short, scoped tasks and latency-sensitive workloads; also stronger on Claude Opus 5 than on earlier Opus models.

If you run at `xhigh` or `max` effort, set a large `max_tokens` so the model has room to think and act; start at 64k tokens and tune from there. Effort is more important for this model than for any prior Opus. Experiment with it actively when you upgrade.

#### Behavior changes

Claude Opus 4.7 introduced several behavioral differences from Claude Opus 4.6 that are not API breaking changes but may require prompt updates or scaffolding removal. They carry forward to Claude Opus 5, with the adjustments noted below.

1. **Response length varies by use case:** Claude Opus 4.7 calibrates response length to how complex it judges the task to be, rather than defaulting to a fixed verbosity. This usually means shorter answers on simple lookups and much longer ones on open-ended analysis.

   If your product depends on a certain style or verbosity of output, you may need to tune your prompts. For example, to decrease verbosity, add: "Provide concise, focused responses. Skip non-essential context, and keep examples minimal." If you see specific kinds of over-explaining, add targeted instructions in your prompt to prevent them.

   Positive examples showing how Claude can communicate with the appropriate level of concision tend to be more effective than negative examples or instructions that tell the model what not to do. On Claude Opus 5, default visible responses and written deliverables run longer than on earlier Opus models, and lowering effort reduces thinking volume without reliably shortening the visible response; prompt explicitly for conciseness or a target length. See [Response length and verbosity](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#response-length-and-verbosity).

2. **More literal instruction following:** Claude Opus 4.7 interprets prompts more literally and explicitly than Claude Opus 4.6, particularly at lower effort levels. It does not silently generalize an instruction from one item to another, and it does not infer requests you didn't make. The upside of this literalism is precision and less thrash. It generally performs better for API use cases with carefully tuned prompts, structured extraction, and pipelines where you want predictable behavior. A prompt and harness review may be especially helpful for migration to Claude Opus 5.

3. **More direct tone:** As with any new model, prose style on long-form writing may shift. Claude Opus 4.7 is more direct and opinionated, with less validation-forward phrasing and fewer emoji than Claude Opus 4.6's warmer style. If your product relies on a specific voice, re-evaluate style prompts against the new baseline.

4. **Built-in progress updates in agentic traces:** Claude Opus 4.7 provides more regular, higher-quality updates to the user throughout long agentic traces. If you've added scaffolding to force interim status messages ("After every 3 tool calls, summarize progress"), try removing it. If you find that the length or contents of Claude Opus 4.7's user-facing updates are not well-calibrated to your use case, explicitly describe what these updates should look like in the prompt and provide examples.

5. **Subagent spawning changed:** Claude Opus 4.7 tends to spawn fewer subagents by default than Claude Opus 4.6, while Claude Opus 5 delegates to subagents more readily than earlier models. The behavior is steerable through prompting in either direction; give explicit guidance around when subagents are desirable, or cap the number of subagents. See [Controlling subagent spawning](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#controlling-subagent-spawning).

6. **Stricter effort calibration:** Meaningfully changing from Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Opus 4.7 respects [effort levels](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) strictly, especially at the low end. At `low` and `medium`, the model scopes its work to what was asked rather than doing more than requested.

   This is good for latency and cost, but on moderately complex tasks running at `low` effort there is some risk of under-thinking. If you observe shallow reasoning on complex problems, raise effort to `high` or `xhigh` rather than prompting around it.

   If you need to keep effort at `low` for latency, add targeted guidance: "This task involves multistep reasoning. Think carefully through the problem before responding." See [Recommended effort levels for Claude Opus 4.7](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort#recommended-effort-levels-for-claude-opus-4-7).

7. **Fewer tool calls by default:** Claude Opus 4.7 has a tendency to use tools less often than Claude Opus 4.6 and to use reasoning more. This produces better results in most cases.

   To increase tool usage, raise the effort setting. `high` or `xhigh` effort settings show substantially more tool usage in agentic search and coding. You can also adjust your prompt to explicitly instruct the model about when and how to properly use its tools.

8. **Real-time cybersecurity safeguards:** Newly added in Claude Opus 4.7, requests that involve prohibited or high-risk topics may lead to refusals. For legitimate security work such as penetration testing, vulnerability research, or red-teaming, apply to the [Cyber Verification Program](https://claude.com/form/cyber-use-case) to request reduced restrictions. See [Safeguards, warnings, and appeals](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8241253-safeguards-warnings-and-appeals) for background.

9. **High-resolution image support:** Claude Opus 4.7 is the first Claude model with high-resolution image support. Maximum image resolution is 2,576 pixels on the long edge, up from 1,568 pixels on prior models. This unlocks gains on vision-heavy workloads and is particularly valuable for computer use, screenshot understanding, and document analysis.

   High-resolution support is automatic and requires no beta header or client-side opt-in. Two things to plan for:

   * Full-resolution images can use up to approximately 3x more image tokens than on prior models (up to 4,784 tokens per image, compared to the previous cap of roughly 1,600 tokens per image). Re-budget `max_tokens` and cost expectations for image-heavy workloads, or downsample before sending if you do not need the additional fidelity.
   * Pointing and bounding-box coordinates returned by the model are 1:1 with actual image pixels on Claude Opus 4.7, so no scale-factor conversion is required.

   See [High-resolution image support on Claude Opus 4.7](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision#high-resolution-image-support-on-claude-opus-4-7) for details.

#### Recommended changes

These are not required but will improve your experience:

1. **Re-evaluate `max_tokens`:** Because the same text produces a higher token count on Claude Opus 4.7 and later models, update your `max_tokens` parameters to give additional headroom, including compaction triggers. Prompting interventions, [`task_budget`](/docs/en/build-with-claude/task-budgets), and [`effort`](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) can help control costs and ensure appropriate token usage.

2. **Audit token-count expectations:** Any code path that estimates tokens client-side or assumes a fixed token-to-character ratio should be re-tested against Claude Opus 5. Use the [Token counting endpoint](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) to verify.

3. **Adopt [task budgets](/docs/en/build-with-claude/task-budgets) (beta):** Claude Opus 4.7 introduces task budgets. These budgets let you inform Claude how many tokens it has for a full agentic loop, including thinking, tool calls, tool results, and final output. The model sees a running countdown and uses it to prioritize work and finish the task gracefully as the budget is consumed. To use, set the beta header `task-budgets-2026-03-13` and add the following to your output config:

   <CodeGroup exclude="shell">
     ```python Python
     output_config = {
         "effort": "high",
         "task_budget": {"type": "tokens", "total": 128000},
     }
     ```

     ```typescript TypeScript
     const output_config = {
       effort: "high",
       task_budget: { type: "tokens", total: 128000 }
     };
     ```

     ```csharp C#
     var outputConfig = new BetaOutputConfig
     {
         Effort = Effort.High,
         TaskBudget = new BetaTokenTaskBudget
         {
             Total = 128000,
         },
     };
     ```

     ```go Go
     outputConfig := anthropic.BetaOutputConfigParam{
     	Effort: anthropic.BetaOutputConfigEffortHigh,
     	TaskBudget: anthropic.BetaTokenTaskBudgetParam{
     		Total: 128000,
     	},
     }
     ```

     ```java Java
     BetaOutputConfig outputConfig = BetaOutputConfig.builder()
         .effort(BetaOutputConfig.Effort.HIGH)
         .taskBudget(BetaTokenTaskBudget.builder()
             .total(128000L)
             .build())
         .build();
     ```

     ```php PHP
     $outputConfig = [
         'effort' => 'high',
         'taskBudget' => [
             'type' => 'tokens',
             'total' => 128000,
         ],
     ];
     ```

     ```ruby Ruby
     output_config = {
       effort: :high,
       task_budget: {
         type: :tokens,
         total: 128_000
       }
     }
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   You may need to experiment with different task budgets for your use case. If the model is given a task budget that is too restrictive, it may complete the task less thoroughly, referencing its budget as the constraint.

   For open-ended agentic tasks where quality matters more than speed, do not set a task budget. Reserve task budgets for workloads where you need the model to scope its work to a token allowance. The minimum value for a task budget is 20k tokens.

   A task budget is not a hard cap; it's a suggestion that the model is aware of. It differs from `max_tokens`:

   * **`task_budget`:** an advisory cap across the full agentic loop. The model sees it and uses it to pace itself.
   * **`max_tokens`:** a hard per-request ceiling on generated tokens. It is not passed to the model, so the model is not aware of it.

   Use `task_budget` when you want the model to self-moderate, and `max_tokens` as a hard ceiling to cap usage.

4. **Set a large `max_tokens` at `max` or `xhigh` effort:** If you are running Claude Opus 4.7 or a later model at `max` or `xhigh` effort, set a large max output token budget so the model has room to think and act across its subagents and tool calls. Start at 64k tokens and tune from there.

5. **Downsample images if high resolution is unnecessary:** Claude Opus 4.7 and later models support images up to 2576px / 3.75MP. High-res images use more tokens. If the additional image fidelity is unnecessary, downsample images before sending to Claude to avoid token-usage increases. See [Images and vision](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision).

6. **Consider automatic fallbacks:** Claude Opus 5 ships with cybersecurity safety classifiers whose cyber-category refusals can fall back to Claude Opus 4.8. To re-run refused requests on another model automatically, consider the `fallbacks` parameter with the `"default"` mode (`fallbacks: "default"`), which selects a recommended fallback model based on the refusal category instead of a hand-maintained model list. The `"default"` mode is in beta and requires the `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01` beta header. See [Refusals and fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback).

7. **Cache shorter prompts:** The minimum cacheable prompt length on Claude Opus 5 is 512 tokens, lower than on earlier Opus models. Prompts that were too short to cache can now create cache entries, with no code changes required. See [Prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#cache-limitations) for per-model minimums.

8. **Change tools mid-conversation (beta):** You can add or remove tools between turns of a conversation without invalidating [prompt cache](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) hits on earlier turns. Send the beta header `mid-conversation-tool-changes-2026-07-01`. This is useful for agentic workloads that expose tools progressively or retire them as a task advances; without it, a changed tool list invalidates the cached prefix.

9. **Remove carried-over verification instructions and constrain scope:** Claude Opus 5 verifies its own work without being told to, so remove explicit verification or self-check instructions carried over from prompts tuned for earlier models; leaving them in causes over-verification. For narrow tasks, constrain the task scope explicitly. See [Task scope and over-verification](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompting-claude-opus-5#task-scope-and-over-verification).

#### Migration checklist

* Update model name from `claude-opus-4-6` to `claude-opus-5` (or update aliases).
* Remove `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` from request payloads.
* Replace `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` with `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` plus the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort), or remove the `thinking` field entirely; adaptive thinking is on by default on Claude Opus 5.
* Review workloads that ran without a `thinking` field: they run with thinking on Claude Opus 5. Revisit `max_tokens`, which remains a hard limit on total output (thinking plus response text), or pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` at effort `high` or below to preserve the old behavior.
* Audit requests that disable thinking: `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` with effort `xhigh` or `max` returns a 400 error, enforced on each request. Re-enable thinking or lower the effort to `high` or below.
* Remove any assistant-message prefills.
* If your UI displays thinking content, explicitly opt in to thinking summarization.
* Re-benchmark end-to-end cost and latency under the updated tokenization.
* Re-tune `max_tokens` to account for the updated tokenization.
* Re-test any client-side token-count estimations.
* If your application sends images, re-budget for [high-resolution image support](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision#high-resolution-image-support-on-claude-opus-4-7) (up to approximately 3x more image tokens per full-resolution image). Downsample before sending if you do not need the additional fidelity.
* If you consume pointing or bounding-box coordinates from the model, remove any scale-factor conversion; coordinates are 1:1 with actual image pixels on Claude Opus 4.7 and later models.
* Review prompts for the behavior changes (response length, literalism, tone, progress updates, subagents, effort calibration, tool triggering, cyber safeguards, high-resolution image handling).
* Re-baseline response length with existing length-control prompts removed, then tune explicitly.
* If using `xhigh` or `max` effort, raise `max_tokens` to at least 64k as a starting point.
* Consider adopting task budgets (beta) and mid-conversation tool changes (beta) for agentic workflows.
* Handle `stop_reason: "refusal"`, and consider `fallbacks: "default"` (beta) to re-run refused requests on a recommended fallback model automatically.
* Review prompts near the caching minimum: prompts of 512 tokens or more can now create cache entries on Claude Opus 5.
* If you use [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool), plan an alternative: it is not available on Claude Opus 5.
* If your organization has a [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) commitment, note that Priority Tier is not supported on Claude Opus 5.
* Remove verification and self-check instructions carried over from prompts tuned for earlier models; they cause over-verification on Claude Opus 5.
* If your product does legitimate security work, apply to the [Cyber Verification Program](https://claude.com/form/cyber-use-case) for access to lower restrictions on cyber content.

#### Migrating from Claude Opus 4.5 or earlier

If you are migrating from Claude Opus 4.5, Opus 4.1 (deprecated), or an earlier model directly to Claude Opus 5, apply **all of the changes earlier in this section** plus the cumulative changes below, which took effect between Opus 4.5 and Opus 4.7. If you are migrating from Opus 4.6, the changes earlier in this section are all you need.

##### Update your model name

```python
# Opus migration
model = "claude-opus-4-5"  # Before
model = "claude-opus-5"  # After
```

##### Breaking changes

1. **Prefill removal** is covered in the [breaking changes for migrating from Claude Opus 4.6](#opus-46-breaking-changes).

2. **Tool parameter quoting:** Claude Opus 4.6 and later models may produce slightly different JSON string escaping in tool call arguments (for example, different handling of Unicode escapes or forward slash escaping). If you parse tool call `input` as a raw string rather than using a JSON parser, verify your parsing logic. Standard JSON parsers (such as `json.loads()` or `JSON.parse()`) handle these differences automatically.

##### Recommended changes

These changes improve your experience on Claude Opus 4.7 and later models. Items marked **(required on Opus 4.7)** were optional recommendations when Opus 4.6 launched but are now mandatory; the rest remain recommended.

1. **Migrate to adaptive thinking (required on Opus 4.7):** `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` returns a 400 error on Claude Opus 4.7 and later models. Switch to `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` and use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to control thinking depth; on Claude Opus 5, `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` is equivalent to omitting the `thinking` field, which runs with adaptive thinking by default. See [Thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking).

       output_config: { effort: "high" },
       messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Your prompt here" }]
     )
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   Note that the migration also moves from `client.beta.messages.create` to `client.messages.create`. Adaptive thinking and effort are GA features and do not require the beta SDK namespace or any beta headers.

2. **Remove effort beta header:** The effort parameter is now GA. Remove `betas=["effort-2025-11-24"]` from your requests.

3. **Remove fine-grained tool streaming beta header:** Fine-grained tool streaming is now GA. Remove `betas=["fine-grained-tool-streaming-2025-05-14"]` from your requests.

4. **Remove interleaved thinking beta header:** Adaptive thinking automatically enables interleaved thinking on Claude Opus 4.7, Opus 4.6, and Sonnet 4.6. Remove `betas=["interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14"]` from your requests. The header is still functional on Sonnet 4.6 with manual extended thinking, but manual mode is deprecated.

5. **Migrate to output\_config.format:** If using structured outputs, update `output_format={...}` to `output_config={"format": {...}}`. The old parameter remains functional but is deprecated and will be removed in a future model release.

#### Migrating from Claude 4.1 or earlier

If you're migrating from Opus 4.1 (deprecated) or earlier models directly to Claude Opus 5, apply all of the changes earlier in this section, plus the additional changes in this sub-section.

```python
# From Opus 4.1
model = "claude-opus-4-1-20250805"  # Before
model = "claude-opus-5"  # After

# From Sonnet 3.7
model = "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"  # Before
model = "claude-opus-5"  # After
```

##### Additional breaking changes

1. **Remove sampling parameters**

   <Warning>
     This is a breaking change when migrating from Claude 3.x models.
   </Warning>

   Starting with Claude Opus 4.7, setting `temperature`, `top_p`, or `top_k` to any non-default value returns a 400 error. The safest migration path is to omit these parameters entirely from requests, and to use prompting to guide the model's behavior. If you were using `temperature = 0` for determinism, note that it never guaranteed identical outputs.

2. **Update tool versions**

   <Warning>
     This is a breaking change when migrating from Claude 3.x models.
   </Warning>

   Update to the latest tool versions. Remove any code using the `undo_edit` command.

   <CodeGroup exclude="shell">
     ```python Python
     # Before
     tools = [{"type": "text_editor_20250124", "name": "str_replace_editor"}]

     ```

     ```typescript TypeScript

     ```
   </CodeGroup>

   * **Text editor:** Use `text_editor_20250728` and `str_replace_based_edit_tool`. See [Text editor tool](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/text-editor-tool) documentation for details.
   * **Code execution:** Upgrade to `code_execution_20260521`. See [Code execution tool](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#upgrade-to-latest-tool-version) documentation for migration instructions.

3. **Handle the `refusal` stop reason**

   Update your application to [handle `refusal` stop reasons](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/handle-streaming-refusals):

   <CodeGroup exclude="shell">
     ```python Python
     response = client.messages.create(...)

     if response.stop_reason == "refusal":
         # Handle refusal appropriately
         pass
     ```

     ```typescript TypeScript
     const response = await client.messages.create(/* ... */);

     if (response.stop_reason === "refusal") {
       // Handle refusal appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```csharp C#
     var response = await client.Messages.Create(...);

     if (response.StopReason?.Value() == StopReason.Refusal)
     {
         // Handle refusal appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```go Go
     response, _ := client.Messages.New(ctx, params) // your existing request

     if response.StopReason == anthropic.StopReasonRefusal {
     	// Handle refusal appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```java Java
     Message response = client.messages().create(...);

     StopReason reason = response.stopReason().orElse(StopReason.END_TURN);
     if (reason.equals(StopReason.REFUSAL)) {
         // Handle refusal appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```php PHP
     $response = $client->messages->create(...);

     if ($response->stopReason === 'refusal') {
         // Handle refusal appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```ruby Ruby
     response = client.messages.create(...)

     if response.stop_reason == :refusal
       # Handle refusal appropriately
     end
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

4. **Handle the `model_context_window_exceeded` stop reason**

   Claude 4.5+ models return a `model_context_window_exceeded` stop reason when generation stops because of hitting the context window limit, rather than the requested `max_tokens` limit. Update your application to handle this new stop reason:

   <CodeGroup exclude="shell">
     ```python Python
     response = client.messages.create(...)

     if response.stop_reason == "model_context_window_exceeded":
         # Handle context window limit appropriately
         pass
     ```

     ```typescript TypeScript
     const response = await client.messages.create(/* ... */);

     if (response.stop_reason === "model_context_window_exceeded") {
       // Handle context window limit appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```csharp C#
     var response = await client.Messages.Create(...);

     if (response.StopReason?.Raw() == "model_context_window_exceeded")
     {
         // Handle context window limit appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```go Go
     response, _ := client.Messages.New(ctx, params) // your existing request

     if response.StopReason == "model_context_window_exceeded" {
     	// Handle context window limit appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```java Java
     Message response = client.messages().create(...);

     StopReason reason = response.stopReason().orElse(StopReason.END_TURN);
     if (reason.equals(StopReason.of("model_context_window_exceeded"))) {
         // Handle context window limit appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```php PHP
     $response = $client->messages->create(...);

     if ($response->stopReason === 'model_context_window_exceeded') {
         // Handle context window limit appropriately
     }
     ```

     ```ruby Ruby
     response = client.messages.create(...)

     if response.stop_reason == :model_context_window_exceeded
       # Handle context window limit appropriately
     end
     ```
   </CodeGroup>

5. **Verify tool parameter handling (trailing newlines)**

   Claude 4.5+ models preserve trailing newlines in tool call string parameters that were previously stripped. If your tools rely on exact string matching against tool call parameters, verify your logic handles trailing newlines correctly.

6. **Update your prompts for behavioral changes**

   Claude 4+ models have a more concise, direct communication style and require explicit direction. Review [prompting best practices](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices) for optimization guidance.

##### Additional recommended changes

* **Remove legacy beta headers:** Remove `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19` and `output-128k-2025-02-19`. All Claude 4+ models have built-in token-efficient tool use and these headers have no effect.

#### Migration checklist (from Claude Opus 4.5 or earlier)

* Update model ID to `claude-opus-5`
* Apply all of the [breaking changes for migrating from Claude Opus 4.6](#opus-46-breaking-changes) (extended thinking removed, thinking on by default, effort cap on disabling thinking, sampling parameters removed, thinking display omitted by default, updated tokenization)
* **BREAKING:** Remove assistant message prefills (returns 400 error); use structured outputs or `output_config.format` instead
* **BREAKING on Opus 4.7:** Replace `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` with `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` plus the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) (returns 400 on Opus 4.7)
* Verify tool call JSON parsing uses a standard JSON parser
* Remove `effort-2025-11-24` beta header (effort is now GA)
* Remove `fine-grained-tool-streaming-2025-05-14` beta header
* Remove `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` beta header (adaptive thinking enables interleaved thinking automatically)
* Migrate `output_format` to `output_config.format` (if applicable)
* If migrating from Claude 4.1 or earlier: remove `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` (non-default values return 400 on Opus 4.7)
* If migrating from Claude 4.1 or earlier: update tool versions (`text_editor_20250728`, `code_execution_20260521`)
* If migrating from Claude 4.1 or earlier: handle `refusal` stop reason
* If migrating from Claude 4.1 or earlier: handle `model_context_window_exceeded` stop reason
* If migrating from Claude 4.1 or earlier: verify tool string parameter handling for trailing newlines
* If migrating from Claude 4.1 or earlier: remove legacy beta headers (`token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19`, `output-128k-2025-02-19`)
* Review and update prompts following [prompting best practices](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices)
* Test in development environment before production deployment

### Migrating to Claude Opus 5 from Claude Sonnet 5

Claude Opus 5 and Claude Sonnet 5 share the same API surface: both run with [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) on by default, both default the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to `high` on the Claude API and Claude Code, both serve a [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) by default with [128k max output tokens](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview), and neither supports [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models). Manual extended thinking and non-default sampling parameters return a 400 error on both models, as does assistant prefill.

#### Update your model name

```python
model = "claude-sonnet-5"  # Before
model = "claude-opus-5"  # After
```

#### What changed

1. **Pricing:** Claude Opus 5 is priced at $5 per million input tokens and $25 per million output tokens. For Claude Sonnet 5, introductory pricing of $2/$10 per million input/output tokens is in effect through August 31, 2026, after which the standard pricing of $3/$15 takes effect. See [Claude pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) for complete pricing.

2. **Disabling thinking is capped at `high` effort:** On Claude Sonnet 5, `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` is accepted at any effort level. On Claude Opus 5, it is accepted only at an [effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) level of `high` or below; a request that combines `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` with effort `xhigh` or `max` returns a 400 error, enforced on each request. Audit requests that disable thinking before you migrate.

3. **Mid-conversation system messages:** Claude Opus 5 accepts `role: "system"` messages immediately after a user turn in the `messages` array (subject to [placement rules](/docs/en/build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages#limitations)); Claude Sonnet 5 does not. If you maintain code paths that rebuild the full message history to update instructions, you can simplify them and preserve [prompt cache](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) hits on earlier turns.

4. **Web fetch is not available:** The [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool) tool is available on Claude Sonnet 5 but not on Claude Opus 5.

#### Migration checklist

* Update the model name from `claude-sonnet-5` to `claude-opus-5`.
* Audit requests that disable thinking: `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` with effort `xhigh` or `max` returns a 400 error on Claude Opus 5. Re-enable thinking or lower the effort to `high` or below.
* If you use [web fetch](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-fetch-tool), plan an alternative: it is not available on Claude Opus 5.
* Re-run [token counting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) against Claude Opus 5 rather than reusing counts measured against Claude Sonnet 5, and re-baseline cost and latency on your own workloads; per-token pricing differs.

***

## Migrating to Claude Sonnet 5

Claude Sonnet 5 offers the best combination of speed and intelligence in the Claude model family. It builds on Claude Sonnet 4.6.

Claude Sonnet 5 is a drop-in upgrade for Claude Sonnet 4.6. Introductory pricing of $2/$10 USD per million input/output tokens is in effect through August 31, 2026, after which the standard pricing of $3/$15 USD per million input/output tokens will take effect; see [Pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing#claude-sonnet-5-introductory-pricing) for details. There are two breaking API changes for code already running on Claude Sonnet 4.6: manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) and sampling parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`) set to non-default values are no longer accepted and return a 400 error. Use [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) with the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) instead. Claude Sonnet 5 supports the same set of features as Claude Sonnet 4.6, including the [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows), [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking), [prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching), [batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing), the [Files API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/files), [PDF support](/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support), [vision](/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision), and the full set of server-side and client-side [tools](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview). [Priority Tier](/docs/en/api/service-tiers#supported-models) is not available on Claude Sonnet 5. Claude Sonnet 5 also uses a new tokenizer.

### Migrating to Claude Sonnet 5 from Claude Sonnet 4.6

<Note>
  If your code is on Claude Sonnet 4.5 or earlier, also apply [Migrating to Claude Sonnet 5 from Claude Sonnet 4.5 and earlier Sonnet models](#migrating-from-sonnet-45). Those steps include breaking changes (assistant message prefilling rejected, tool parameter JSON escaping differences) that this section alone does not cover.
</Note>

#### Update your model name

```python
# Sonnet migration
model = "claude-sonnet-4-6"  # Before
model = "claude-sonnet-5"  # After
```

#### What changed

Items 4 and 5 in the following list are breaking changes. `max_tokens` remains a hard limit on total output (thinking plus response text), so revisit it for workloads that ran without thinking on Claude Sonnet 4.6.

1. **New tokenizer:** Claude Sonnet 5 uses a new tokenizer. The same input text produces approximately 30% more tokens than on Claude Sonnet 4.6. The exact increase depends on the content. Requests, responses, and streaming events keep the same shape, and no code changes are required, but anything you measure or budget in tokens shifts: `usage` fields and [token counting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) results for the same text are higher, the 1M token context window holds less text, and a `max_tokens` limit tuned for Claude Sonnet 4.6 may truncate equivalent output. Per-token pricing is unchanged, so the cost of an equivalent request can differ. Re-run token counting against Claude Sonnet 5 rather than reusing counts measured against earlier models.

2. **128k max output tokens (unchanged):** Claude Sonnet 5 supports up to 128k output tokens, the same as Claude Sonnet 4.6. Existing `max_tokens` values remain valid. Account for the new tokenizer when sizing them.

3. **Assistant message prefilling (unchanged):** Prefilling the assistant message returns a `400` error on Claude Sonnet 5, the same as on Claude Sonnet 4.6. If you removed prefill when migrating to Claude Sonnet 4.6, no further changes are needed. Use [structured outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs), system prompt instructions, or `output_config.format` instead.

4. **Adaptive thinking on by default:** On Claude Sonnet 4.6, requests without a `thinking` field run without thinking; on Claude Sonnet 5, the same requests run with [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking). To turn thinking off, pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}`. Manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) is not supported and returns a 400 error. Use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) (default `high`) to control thinking depth.

   <Tabs>
     <Tab title="Claude Sonnet 5">
       <Note>
         Adaptive thinking is on by default for Claude Sonnet 5. The `thinking` field is shown explicitly here to set `display: "summarized"`; if you omit `thinking`, Claude Sonnet 5 omits thinking content from the response by default. For per-model defaults, see [Configurations each model rejects](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking-troubleshooting#rejected-configurations).

5. **Sampling parameters removed:** Sampling parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`) set to a non-default value are not accepted and return a 400 error.

6. **Cybersecurity safeguards:** Claude Sonnet 5 is the first Sonnet-tier model with real-time cybersecurity safeguards. Requests that involve prohibited or high-risk cybersecurity topics may be refused. Refusals return as a successful HTTP 200 response with `stop_reason: "refusal"`, not an error. See [Safeguards, warnings, and appeals](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8241253-safeguards-warnings-and-appeals) for background.

#### Migration checklist

* Update model name from `claude-sonnet-4-6` to `claude-sonnet-5`.
* Re-run [token counting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) against Claude Sonnet 5. The new tokenizer produces approximately 30% more tokens for the same text, which can change per-request cost even though per-token pricing is unchanged. The exact increase depends on the content and workload shape.
* Revisit `max_tokens` limits sized close to your expected output length, and raise them up to the 128k maximum (unchanged from Claude Sonnet 4.6) where useful.
* Remove `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` configuration (returns a 400 error). Adaptive thinking is on by default; pass `{type: "disabled"}` to turn it off, or use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to control depth.
* Remove `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` parameters set to non-default values (they return a 400 error on Claude Sonnet 5).
* Add handling for `stop_reason: "refusal"` if your workload may touch cybersecurity topics.
* Re-baseline cost on your typical workload before production deployment.
* Review `max_tokens` for workloads that previously ran without thinking.

### Migrating to Claude Sonnet 5 from Claude Sonnet 4.5 and earlier Sonnet models

If you are migrating from Claude Sonnet 4.5 or an earlier Sonnet model directly to Claude Sonnet 5, apply the [Migrating to Claude Sonnet 5 from Claude Sonnet 4.6](#migrating-from-claude-sonnet-4-6-to-claude-sonnet-5) changes plus the changes in this section.

<Warning>
  Claude Sonnet 5 defaults to an effort level of `high`, in contrast to Sonnet 4.5 which had no effort parameter. Consider adjusting the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) as you migrate. If not explicitly set, you may experience higher latency with the default effort level.
</Warning>

#### Breaking changes

##### When migrating from Sonnet 4.5

1. **Prefilling assistant messages is no longer supported**

   <Warning>
     This is a breaking change when migrating from Sonnet 4.5 or earlier.
   </Warning>

   Prefilling assistant messages returns a `400` error on Claude Sonnet 4.6 and later models, including Claude Sonnet 5. Use [structured outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs), system prompt instructions, or `output_config.format` instead.

   **Common prefill use cases and migrations:**

   * **Controlling output formatting** (forcing JSON/YAML output): Use [structured outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) or tools with enum fields for classification tasks.

   * **Eliminating preambles** (removing "Here is..." phrases): Add direct instructions in the system prompt: "Respond directly without preamble. Do not start with phrases like 'Here is...', 'Based on...', etc."

   * **Avoiding bad refusals:** Claude is much better at appropriate refusals now. Clear prompting in the user message without prefill should be sufficient.

   * **Continuations** (resuming interrupted responses): Move the continuation to the user message: "Your previous response was interrupted and ended with `[previous_response]`. Continue from where you left off."

   * **Context hydration / role consistency** (refreshing context in long conversations): Inject what were previously prefilled-assistant reminders into the user turn instead.

2. **Tool parameter JSON escaping may differ**

   <Warning>
     This is a breaking change when migrating from Sonnet 4.5 or earlier.
   </Warning>

   JSON string escaping in tool parameters may differ from previous models. Standard JSON parsers handle this automatically, but custom string-based parsing may need updates.

**Extended thinking changes:** `budget_tokens` configurations from Claude Sonnet 4.5 (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) are not supported on Claude Sonnet 5 and return a 400 error. Adaptive thinking is on by default, so most workloads need no `thinking` configuration at all; use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to control thinking depth. If you ran Claude Sonnet 4.5 without extended thinking, pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` to preserve that behavior.

##### When migrating from Claude 3.x

3. **Remove sampling parameters**

   <Warning>
     This is a breaking change when migrating from Claude 3.x models.
   </Warning>

   Sampling parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`) set to a non-default value return a 400 error on Claude Sonnet 5. Remove them from requests, and use prompting to guide the model's behavior instead.

4. **Update tool versions**

   <Warning>
     This is a breaking change when migrating from Claude 3.x models.
   </Warning>

   Update to the latest tool versions (`text_editor_20250728`, `code_execution_20260521`). Remove any code using the `undo_edit` command.

5. **Handle the `refusal` stop reason**

   Update your application to [handle `refusal` stop reasons](/docs/en/test-and-evaluate/strengthen-guardrails/handle-streaming-refusals).

6. **Update your prompts for behavioral changes**

   Claude 4 models have a more concise, direct communication style. Review [prompting best practices](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices) for optimization guidance.

### Migrating to Claude Sonnet 5 from Claude Haiku 4.5

Claude Haiku 4.5 and Claude Sonnet 5 differ more at the API level than adjacent models within one class: Claude Haiku 4.5 uses manual [extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) (off by default), a 200k token context window, and up to 64k output tokens, while Claude Sonnet 5 runs with [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) on by default, serves a [1M token context window](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) by default, and supports up to [128k output tokens](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview).

#### Update your model name

```python
model = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"  # Before
model = "claude-sonnet-5"  # After
```

#### What changed

1. **Thinking configuration:** Claude Haiku 4.5 supports manual extended thinking (`thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`) and rejects `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}`. On Claude Sonnet 5, the support is reversed: adaptive thinking is on by default, and manual extended thinking returns a 400 error. Remove `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` configurations and rely on the default, or pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` to turn thinking off. `budget_tokens` has no direct replacement; use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) to control thinking depth. Effort is not available on Claude Haiku 4.5 and defaults to `high` on Claude Sonnet 5.

2. **Sampling parameters removed:** `temperature` and `top_p` work on Claude Haiku 4.5 (one at a time, not both). On Claude Sonnet 5, setting `temperature`, `top_p`, or `top_k` to a non-default value returns a 400 error. Remove these parameters and use prompting to guide the model's behavior.

3. **Assistant prefill removed:** Prefilling the assistant message works on Claude Haiku 4.5 but returns a 400 error on Claude Sonnet 5. Use [structured outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs), system prompt instructions, or `output_config.format` instead.

4. **Larger context window and output:** Claude Sonnet 5 serves a 1M token context window by default, up from 200k tokens on Claude Haiku 4.5, and supports up to 128k output tokens, up from 64k. Claude Sonnet 5 also uses a different tokenizer, so re-run [token counting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) rather than reusing counts measured against Claude Haiku 4.5.

5. **Pricing:** Claude Haiku 4.5 is priced at $1/$5 per million input/output tokens. For Claude Sonnet 5, introductory pricing of $2/$10 per million input/output tokens is in effect through August 31, 2026, after which the standard pricing of $3/$15 takes effect. See [Claude pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing).

6. **Cybersecurity safeguards:** Claude Sonnet 5 has real-time cybersecurity safeguards. Requests that involve prohibited or high-risk cybersecurity topics may be refused, returned as a successful HTTP 200 response with `stop_reason: "refusal"`. See [Safeguards, warnings, and appeals](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8241253-safeguards-warnings-and-appeals) for background.

#### Migration checklist

* Update the model name from `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (or the `claude-haiku-4-5` alias) to `claude-sonnet-5`.
* Remove `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}` configuration (returns a 400 error). Adaptive thinking is on by default; pass `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` to preserve no-thinking behavior, and revisit `max_tokens` for workloads that ran without thinking.
* Use the [effort parameter](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) (default `high`) to control thinking depth and token spend; it is not available on Claude Haiku 4.5, so no existing setting carries over.
* Remove `temperature` and `top_p` settings (non-default values return a 400 error on Claude Sonnet 5).
* Remove any assistant-message prefills (they return a 400 error on Claude Sonnet 5).
* Re-run [token counting](/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting) against Claude Sonnet 5, and revisit `max_tokens` limits, which you can raise up to the 128k maximum.
* Add handling for `stop_reason: "refusal"` if your workload may touch cybersecurity topics.
* Re-baseline cost on your typical workload before production deployment; per-token pricing differs.

## Migrating to Claude Haiku 4.5

Claude Haiku 4.5 is the fastest and most intelligent Haiku model with near-frontier performance, delivering premium model quality for interactive applications and high-volume processing.

For a complete overview of capabilities, see the [models overview](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview).

<Note>
  For Claude Haiku 4.5 pricing, see [Claude pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing).
</Note>

<Tip>
  For significant performance improvements on coding and reasoning tasks, consider enabling extended thinking with `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Extended thinking impacts [prompt caching](/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#caching-with-thinking-blocks) efficiency.

  Extended thinking is deprecated in Claude 4.6 models and removed in Claude Opus 4.7. If using newer models, use [adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/thinking) instead.
</Note>

### Migrating to Claude Haiku 4.5 from Claude Haiku 3.5 and earlier Haiku models

**Update your model name:**

```python
# From Haiku 3.5
model = "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"  # Before
model = "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"  # After
```

**Review new rate limits:** Haiku 4.5 has separate rate limits from Haiku 3.5. See [Rate limits](/docs/en/api/rate-limits) documentation for details.
