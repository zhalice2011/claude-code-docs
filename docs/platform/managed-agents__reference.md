# Reference

Event types, self-hosted worker CLI flags, supported MCP server types, rate limits, and branding guidelines for Claude Managed Agents.

---

This page collects reference material for Claude Managed Agents. For task-oriented guides, follow the links in each section. For the operations on the session resource, see [Session operations](/docs/en/managed-agents/session-operations).

<Note>
  Managed Agents API requests require the `managed-agents-2026-04-01` beta header, except memory store endpoints, which use `agent-memory-2026-07-22` instead. The SDK sets the correct beta header automatically. See [Beta headers](/docs/en/api/beta-headers#endpoint-specific-headers).
</Note>

## Event types

Persisted event type strings follow a `{domain}.{action}` naming convention; the stream-only event deltas (see the Event deltas tab) are the exception. See [Session event stream](/docs/en/managed-agents/events-and-streaming) for sending, streaming, and listing events.

    | `user.tool_result`        | For sessions with `self_hosted` [environments](/docs/en/managed-agents/self-hosted-sandboxes) only, your integration is responsible for providing `agent_toolset` results. The SDK helpers and CLI do this automatically. |

  <Tab title="Span events">
    Span events are observability markers that wrap activity for timing and usage tracking.

    | Type                              | Description                                                                                |

    | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `system.message` | Update the agent's system prompt between turns. Only supported on Claude Opus 4.8. |
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Event deltas">
    Event deltas are stream-only preview events. They are emitted on session event stream connections that opt in with the `event_deltas[]` parameter, and they are never persisted to the session's event history. See [Event deltas](/docs/en/managed-agents/events-and-streaming#event-deltas) for opting in, accumulating, and reconciling them.

    | Type          | Description                                                                                                              |
    | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `event_start` | A previewed event has started generating. Carries the upcoming event's `type` and `id`. Stream-only and never persisted. |
    | `event_delta` | Incremental content for a previewed event, identified by `event_id`. Stream-only and never persisted.                    |
  </Tab>

## Self-hosted worker

These are the `ant beta:worker` CLI flags for the pre-built worker that drives a `self_hosted` environment. See [Self-hosted sandboxes](/docs/en/managed-agents/self-hosted-sandboxes) for setting up the environment, running a worker, and the SDK helper options.

| Flag                   | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--environment-id`     | The environment to poll for work. Also reads from `ANTHROPIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID`.                                                                                        |
| `--environment-key`    | Authenticates the worker with this environment. Also reads from `ANTHROPIC_ENVIRONMENT_KEY`.                                                                         |
| `--workdir`            | Directory where skills are downloaded and tools read and write files. Defaults to `.` (the current directory); the system default working directory is `/workspace`. |
| `--on-work`            | Script to call for each claimed work item instead of running tools in-process. Receives session details as environment variables.                                    |
| `--unrestricted-paths` | Allow tool calls to access paths outside `--workdir`.                                                                                                                |
| `--max-idle`           | How long to wait after the session goes idle with an `end_turn` [stop reason](/docs/en/api/handling-stop-reasons) before shutting down. Defaults to `60s`.           |
| `--log-format`         | Log output format. Use `json` for structured log ingestion. Defaults to `text`.                                                                                      |

## Supported MCP server types

Claude Managed Agents connects to [remote MCP servers](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/remote-mcp-servers) that expose an HTTP endpoint, or to private MCP servers through [MCP tunnels](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/overview). The server must support the MCP protocol's streamable HTTP transport. See [MCP connector](/docs/en/managed-agents/mcp-connector) for declaring servers on an agent.

For more information on MCP and building MCP servers, see the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## Rate limits

Managed Agents endpoints are rate-limited per organization:

| Operation                                                     | Limit                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Create endpoints (such as agents, sessions, and environments) | 300 requests per minute   |
| Read endpoints (such as retrieve, list, and stream)           | 1,200 requests per minute |

Organization-level [spend limits and usage-tier rate limits](/docs/en/api/rate-limits) also apply.

## Branding guidelines

For partners integrating Claude Managed Agents, use of Claude branding is optional. When referencing Claude in your product:

**Allowed:**

* "Claude Agent" (preferred for dropdown menus)
* "Claude" (when within a menu already labeled "Agents")
* "\{YourAgentName} Powered by Claude" (if you have an existing agent name)

**Not permitted:**

* "Claude Code" or "Claude Code Agent"
* "Claude Cowork" or "Claude Cowork Agent"
* Claude Code-branded ASCII art or visual elements that mimic Claude Code

Your product should maintain its own branding and not appear to be Claude Code, Claude Cowork, or any other Anthropic product. For questions about branding compliance, contact the Anthropic [sales team](https://www.anthropic.com/contact-sales).
