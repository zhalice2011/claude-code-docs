## Remove Workspace From Service Account

**delete** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces/{workspace_id}`

Remove a service account from a workspace.

Mirror of `DELETE /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts/{service_account_id}`,
addressed from the service-account side. Removal is idempotent (returns
200 even if the membership was already removed). A DELETE against the
implicit default-workspace membership returns 200 but is a no-op and the
membership persists; deleting an explicit default-workspace row reverts
to the implicit `workspace_user` membership. Archived workspaces return
400. Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys are not
accepted.

### Path Parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account.

- `workspace_id: string`

  ID of the workspace.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Returns

- `service_account_id: string`

  Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`) named in the delete request. Removal is idempotent; see the endpoint description for the implicit-membership no-op.

- `type: "service_account_workspace_member_deleted"`

  - `"service_account_workspace_member_deleted"`

- `workspace_id: string`

  Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`) named in the delete request.
