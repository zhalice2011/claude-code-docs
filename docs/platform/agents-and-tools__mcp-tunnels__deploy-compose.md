# Deploy MCP tunnels with Docker Compose

Install the MCP tunnel stack on a VM using Docker Compose.

---

<Note>
  MCP tunnels are in research preview. [Request access](https://claude.com/form/claude-managed-agents) to try them.
</Note>

This guide deploys the [tunnel stack](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts#components) as hardened containers on a single host. The same configuration can be replicated across multiple hosts for availability.

## Before you begin

You need:

* **A tunnel.** With programmatic access, the [setup component](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts#components) creates one for you when you don't supply a tunnel ID; to attach to an existing tunnel instead, [create it in the Console](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console#create-a-tunnel) and record the tunnel ID (`tnl_...`). Manual provisioning always starts from a Console-created tunnel.

* **A way for the host to authenticate to the Tunnels API.**

  * **Programmatic access (recommended).** Turn on **Set up programmatic access** when creating the tunnel (or create the federation rule directly under **Settings > Workload identity** if you're letting the setup component create the tunnel) so the setup component can authenticate through Workload Identity Federation. Record the federation rule ID (`fdrl_...`) and your organization ID.
  * **Manual.** Skip programmatic access. You'll [get the tunnel token from the Console](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console#get-the-connection-details), generate a CA and server certificate yourself, and [register the CA in the Console](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console#add-a-ca-certificate).

* **A host with Docker and Docker Compose** installed. The manual flow also requires `openssl` (1.1.1 or later).

* **Outbound network connectivity** from the host to `api.anthropic.com` (443 TCP) and the [tunnel edge](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts#components) (7844 TCP and UDP). See the full [network requirements](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/overview#network-requirements).

* **One or more MCP servers** running and reachable from the host on the addresses you'll configure under `routes`. If you don't have one yet, [use the sample server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server).

## Optional: Use a sample MCP server

If you don't have an MCP server available for testing, use this minimal one:

```bash
mkdir -p mcp-tunnel
cat > mcp-tunnel/hello_server.py <<'EOF'
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("hello-server", host="0.0.0.0", port=9000)


@mcp.tool()
def hello(name: str = "world") -> str:
    """Say hello to someone."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http")
EOF
```

The following Install steps `cd` into `mcp-tunnel/` and note where to add the corresponding service and route.

## Install

This guide provides one reference approach using Docker Compose. You are responsible for adapting it to meet your organization's security requirements.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="With programmatic access">
    This path requires the host to have an OIDC identity provider (such as a cloud VM metadata server or SPIFFE). If it doesn't, use the **Without programmatic access** tab instead.

    The setup component uses Workload Identity Federation to fetch the tunnel token, generate a CA and server certificate, and register the CA with Anthropic.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Prepare the deployment directory">
        ```bash
        mkdir -p mcp-tunnel/{config,data}
        cd mcp-tunnel
        sudo chown 65532:65532 data
        ```

        The containers run as the non-root UID `65532` and need write access to `data/`.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Write docker-compose.yaml">
        The compose file pins images by SHA-256 digest, runs every container as non-root with a read-only filesystem, drops all Linux capabilities, and disables privilege escalation.

        EOF
        ```

        If you're using the [sample MCP server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server), append it as a service:

        ```bash
        cat >> docker-compose.yaml <<'EOF'

          hello-mcp:
            image: python:3.13-slim
            working_dir: /app
            volumes:
              - ./hello_server.py:/app/hello_server.py:ro
            command: sh -c "pip install --quiet mcp && python hello_server.py"
            restart: unless-stopped
        EOF
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Provision the tunnel">
        Set the identifiers. Leave `TUNNEL_ID` unset to have the setup component create a tunnel; set it to attach to an existing tunnel from the [Console](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console#create-a-tunnel):

        ```bash
        # export TUNNEL_ID=tnl_...   # set to attach to an existing tunnel
        export ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID=fdrl_...
        export ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
        ```

        If your federation rule is scoped to a workspace other than your organization's default, also set `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID=wrkspc_...`; the setup component uses the default workspace otherwise. An auto-created tunnel is created in that workspace.

        Set `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN` to an OIDC JWT from this host's identity provider. Follow the [WIF guide for your provider](/docs/en/manage-claude/workload-identity-federation#identity-providers) to register the issuer, set the rule's subject, and mint the token; the rule's audience must match the audience you request when minting.

        Run the setup component:

        ```bash
        docker compose run --rm setup
        ```

        `setup init` is idempotent over `data/`: re-running it reuses the tunnel ID and CA already stored there and never creates a second tunnel. A new CA is generated and registered only when `data/` is empty or `TUNNEL_ID` has changed; in that case the cap of two active certificates applies, so revoke one in the Console first if both slots are filled.

        See [Setup component authentication failures](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/troubleshooting#setup-component-authentication-failures) if it errors.

        Retrieve your tunnel domain and export it for later steps:

        ```bash
        export TUNNEL_DOMAIN=$(sudo cat data/tunnel-domain)
        echo "$TUNNEL_DOMAIN"
        ```

        <Note>
          Workload Identity Federation tokens are short-lived (1 hour by default) and expire automatically; there is nothing to revoke after setup completes.
        </Note>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Write the proxy config">
        `tunnel_domain` is **required**: the [proxy](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts#components) uses it to strip the domain suffix from incoming hostnames before looking up the subdomain in `routes`. `routes` is a flat map from subdomain to upstream URL, not a list.

        ```bash
        cat > config/mcp-proxy.yaml <<EOF
        listen_addr: ":8080"
        log_level: info
        shutdown_timeout: 30s
        tunnel_domain: ${TUNNEL_DOMAIN}
        tls:
          cert_file: /data/tls.crt
          key_file: /data/tls.key
        routes:
          echo: http://hello-mcp:9000
        EOF
        ```

        The `echo:` route targets the [sample MCP server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server); replace it with (or add) your own routes. See the [proxy configuration](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/reference#proxy-configuration) reference for all available fields.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Start the deployment">
        ```bash
        export TUNNEL_TOKEN=$(sudo cat data/tunnel-token)
        docker compose up -d
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Without programmatic access">
    Use this flow if you didn't turn on **Set up programmatic access**, or for local development and testing. There is no `setup` service.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Get the tunnel token and domain from the Console">
        On the tunnel detail page, copy the **Domain** (it has the form `abcd1234.tunnel.anthropic.com`), then click the eye icon next to **Token** to fetch the tunnel token and use the copy icon to copy it.

        Set both as shell variables for the rest of the guide:

        ```bash
        export TUNNEL_DOMAIN=YOUR_TUNNEL_DOMAIN_HERE
        export TUNNEL_TOKEN='eyJ...'
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Scaffold and generate certificates">
        ```bash
        mkdir -p mcp-tunnel/{data,config}
        cd mcp-tunnel
        ```

        The proxy listens on `:8080` over plain WebSocket; the [inner TLS](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts#components) handshake happens **inside** that WebSocket stream using these certificates. Anthropic verifies the inner handshake against the CA you register in the Console. The server certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) must include `*.<tunnel-domain>` per the [certificate requirements](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/reference#certificate-requirements).

        ```bash
        # Self-signed CA. Explicit extensions so it satisfies the certificate
        # requirements regardless of distro openssl.cnf defaults.
        openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
          -keyout data/ca.key -out data/ca.crt \
          -days 3650 -subj "/CN=mcp-tunnel-ca" \
          -addext "basicConstraints=critical,CA:TRUE" \
          -addext "keyUsage=critical,keyCertSign,cRLSign" \
          -addext "subjectKeyIdentifier=hash"

        # Extension file for the server certificate. Using -extfile (instead of
        # -copy_extensions, which is OpenSSL 3.0+ only) keeps this working on
        # OpenSSL 1.1.x.
        cat > data/tls.ext <<EOF
        subjectAltName = DNS:${TUNNEL_DOMAIN},DNS:*.${TUNNEL_DOMAIN}
        authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid,issuer
        extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
        EOF

        # Server certificate signed by the CA
        openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
          -keyout data/tls.key -out /tmp/server.csr \
          -subj "/CN=${TUNNEL_DOMAIN}"
        openssl x509 -req -in /tmp/server.csr \
          -CA data/ca.crt -CAkey data/ca.key -CAcreateserial \
          -out data/tls.crt -days 90 \
          -extfile data/tls.ext

        # Allow the non-root proxy container (UID 65532) to read the key from
        # the bind mount. Without the world-read bit the container cannot open
        # a host-owned file.
        chmod 644 data/tls.key
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Register the CA certificate in the Console">
        On the tunnel detail page, scroll to the **Certificates** section and click **Add certificate**. Upload `data/ca.crt` directly with **Choose file** (the modal accepts `.pem`, `.crt`, and `.cer`), or paste its contents:

        ```bash
        cat data/ca.crt
        ```

        The tunnel's status flips to **Active** once a certificate is registered. See [Add a CA certificate](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/console#add-a-ca-certificate).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Write the proxy config">
        `tunnel_domain` is **required**: the proxy uses it to strip the domain suffix from incoming hostnames before looking up the subdomain in `routes`. `routes` is a flat map from subdomain to upstream URL, not a list.

        ```bash
        cat > config/mcp-proxy.yaml <<EOF
        listen_addr: ":8080"
        log_level: info
        tunnel_domain: ${TUNNEL_DOMAIN}
        tls:
          cert_file: /data/tls.crt
          key_file: /data/tls.key
        routes:
          echo: http://hello-mcp:9000
        EOF
        ```

        The `echo:` route targets the [sample MCP server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server); replace it with (or add) your own routes. See the [proxy configuration](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/reference#proxy-configuration) reference for all available fields.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Write docker-compose.yaml">
        The `network_mode: "service:mcp-proxy"` setting places [cloudflared](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts#components) in the proxy's network namespace so that `localhost:8080` inside the cloudflared container reaches the proxy. The `--url http://localhost:8080` flag gives cloudflared its forwarding target; without that flag, cloudflared has no route for incoming requests and returns a 503.

        ```bash
        cat > docker-compose.yaml <<'EOF'
        services:
          cloudflared:

            # --url is required: no ingress rules are pushed in the manual flow,

          hello-mcp:
            image: python:3.13-slim
            working_dir: /app
            volumes:
              - ./hello_server.py:/app/hello_server.py:ro
            command: sh -c "pip install --quiet mcp && python hello_server.py"
            restart: unless-stopped
        EOF
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Start the deployment">
        ```bash
        docker compose up -d
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The compose file reads `TUNNEL_TOKEN` from the host environment with no default, so the export must be repeated in every fresh shell and after a reboot.

For a multi-VM deployment, copy the `mcp-tunnel/` directory to each host, set `TUNNEL_TOKEN`, and run `docker compose up -d`. In the programmatic flow `TUNNEL_TOKEN` is `$(sudo cat data/tunnel-token)`; in the manual flow it's the value you copied from the Console. The same tunnel token and certificates work across all replicas.

## Verify the deployment

Verify end to end by calling an [upstream MCP server](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/concepts#components) from Anthropic's side: see [Use the tunneled MCP servers](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/overview#use-the-tunneled-mcp-servers). With the [sample MCP server](#optional-use-a-sample-mcp-server), the routed URL is `https://echo.<your-tunnel-domain>/mcp`. If verification fails, see [Troubleshooting](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-tunnels/troubleshooting).

## Upgrades

Run the commands in this section from inside the `mcp-tunnel/` deployment directory.

### Rotate the tunnel token

With programmatic access, increment `--token-version` in the `setup` service command, set the Workload Identity Federation identifiers, mint a fresh OIDC JWT, and re-run the setup component:

```bash
# Edit docker-compose.yaml: increment the integer in the setup service's
# --token-version argument (for example, --token-version=1 to
# --token-version=2). The setup binary refuses to rotate when the value
# hasn't changed.

# export TUNNEL_ID=tnl_...   # set only if you set it during install
export ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID=fdrl_...
export ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
# export ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID=wrkspc_...   # if your rule is workspace-scoped
# Re-mint ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN per the WIF provider guide for your
# environment (it will have expired since install).
export ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN=...

docker compose run --rm setup

export TUNNEL_TOKEN=$(sudo cat data/tunnel-token)
docker compose up -d cloudflared
```

The `--token-version` argument is edited in `docker-compose.yaml` rather than passed on the command line so the new value persists for future runs of the setup component. The setup component authenticates with Workload Identity Federation; there is no API token to revoke.

Without programmatic access, click **Rotate token** on the tunnel detail page in the Console, then update the `TUNNEL_TOKEN` environment variable on each host and restart cloudflared (`docker compose up -d cloudflared`).

<Warning>
  Clicking **Rotate token** invalidates the current token immediately. Between that moment and updating `TUNNEL_TOKEN` on every host and restarting cloudflared, any host whose cloudflared restarts (crash, host reboot) cannot reconnect. Update each host promptly after rotating.
</Warning>

### Certificate renewal

You're responsible for monitoring expiry and renewing the server certificate before it expires.

With programmatic access:

```bash
docker compose run --rm setup renew-cert --output=dir:/data
```

The CLI arguments replace the `setup` service's `command` (the `init` arguments) but keep its `entrypoint`, so this runs `/setup renew-cert --output=dir:/data`.

<Tip>
  Pass `--renew-before=720h` to make the command a no-op when more than 30 days of validity remain. This makes it safe to run on a fixed schedule.
</Tip>

Without programmatic access, sign a new server certificate with your existing CA (the CA registered in the Console doesn't change) and replace `data/tls.crt`. Set `TUNNEL_DOMAIN` first if you're running this from a fresh shell.

```bash
export TUNNEL_DOMAIN=YOUR_TUNNEL_DOMAIN_HERE
openssl req -new -key data/tls.key -out /tmp/server.csr \
  -subj "/CN=${TUNNEL_DOMAIN}"
openssl x509 -req -in /tmp/server.csr \
  -CA data/ca.crt -CAkey data/ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out data/tls.crt -days 90 \
  -extfile data/tls.ext
```

In either flow the proxy polls `tls.cert_file` and reloads it automatically, so no restart is required.
