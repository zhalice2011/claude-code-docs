# Features overview

Explore Claude's advanced features and capabilities.

---

Claude's API surface is organized into five areas:

- **Model capabilities:** Control how Claude reasons and formats responses.
- **Tools:** Let Claude take actions on the web or in your environment.
- **Tool infrastructure:** Handles discovery and orchestration at scale.
- **Context management:** Keeps long-running sessions efficient.
- **Files and assets:** Manage the documents and data you provide to Claude.

If you're new, start with [model capabilities](#model-capabilities) and [tools](#tools). Return to the other sections when you're ready to optimize cost, latency, or scale.

For administration and governance, see the [Admin API](/docs/en/manage-claude/admin-api), the [Usage and Cost API](/docs/en/manage-claude/usage-cost-api), and the [Compliance API](/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-api).

## Feature availability

Features on the Claude Platform are assigned one of the following availability classifications per platform (shown in the Availability column of each following table). Not all features pass through every stage. A feature may enter at any classification and may skip stages.

| Classification | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Beta**<sup>*</sup> | Preview features used for gathering feedback and iterating on a less mature use case. Availability may be limited, including through sign-up requirements or waitlists, and may not be publicly announced. <br/><br/> Features may change significantly or be discontinued based on feedback. Not guaranteed for ongoing production use. Breaking changes are possible with notice, and some platform-specific limitations may apply. Beta features on the Claude API and [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws) have a [beta header](/docs/en/api/beta-headers). |
| **Generally available (GA)** | Feature is stable, fully supported, and recommended for production use. Should not have a beta header or other indicator that the feature is in a preview state. Covered by standard API [versioning](/docs/en/api/versioning) guarantees. |
| **Deprecated** | Feature is still functional but no longer recommended. A migration path and removal timeline are provided. |
| **Retired** | Feature is no longer available. |

_<sup>*</sup> May carry a qualifier indicating narrower availability or added constraints (for example, "beta: research preview"). See the feature's page for details._

## Model capabilities

Ways to steer Claude and Claude's direct outputs, including response format, reasoning depth, and input modalities.

<Tip>
You can discover which capabilities a model supports programmatically. The [Models API](/docs/en/api/models/list) returns `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`, and a `capabilities` object for every available model.
</Tip>

The ZDR column indicates whether a feature is available under a Zero Data Retention arrangement. For most features this depends only on what the feature mechanism retains; for features tied to specific models, model-level ZDR availability also applies. See [Model-specific data retention requirements](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention#model-specific-data-retention-requirements).

| Feature | Description | Zero Data Retention (ZDR) | Availability |
|---------|-----------|----|--------------|
| [Context windows](/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows) | Up to 1M tokens for processing large documents, extensive code bases, and long conversations. | ZDR eligible | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws bedrock vertexAi azureAiBeta /> |
| [Adaptive thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/adaptive-thinking) | Let Claude dynamically decide when and how much to think. The only thinking mode on Claude Opus 4.8 and Claude Opus 4.7. Use the effort parameter to control thinking depth. | ZDR eligible | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws bedrock vertexAi azureAiBeta /> |
| [Batch processing](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing) | Process large volumes of requests asynchronously for cost savings. Send batches with a large number of queries per batch. Batch API calls cost 50% less than standard API calls. | Not ZDR eligible | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws /> |
| [Citations](/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations) | Ground Claude's responses in source documents. With Citations, Claude can provide detailed references to the exact sentences and passages it uses to generate responses, leading to more verifiable, trustworthy outputs. | ZDR eligible | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws bedrock vertexAi azureAiBeta /> |
| [Data residency](/docs/en/manage-claude/data-residency) | Control where model inference runs using geographic controls. Specify `"global"` or `"us"` routing per request through the `inference_geo` parameter. | ZDR eligible | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws /> |
| [Effort](/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) | Control how many tokens Claude uses when responding with the effort parameter, trading off between response thoroughness and token efficiency. | ZDR eligible | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws bedrock vertexAi azureAiBeta /> |

| [Fallback credit](/docs/en/build-with-claude/fallback-credit) | Avoid paying the prompt-cache cost twice when you retry a refused request on another model. The refusal carries a credit token, and echoing it on the retry bills the retry as though the conversation had been on the new model all along. Credit tokens returned in Message Batches results cannot be redeemed. | Not ZDR eligible* | <PlatformAvailability claudeApiBeta claudePlatformAwsBeta bedrockBeta vertexAiBeta azureAiBeta /> |
| [PDF support](/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support) | Process and analyze text and visual content from PDF documents. | ZDR eligible | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws bedrock vertexAi azureAiBeta /> |

Achieve web search-quality citations for custom knowledge bases and tools. | ZDR eligible | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws bedrock vertexAi azureAiBeta /> |
| [Server-side fallback](/docs/en/build-with-claude/refusals-and-fallback) | Retry a refused request inside a single API call. Name up to three fallback models, and when the requested model declines, the API runs the next model in the chain on the same request. The `fallbacks` parameter is not available in the Message Batches API. | Not ZDR eligible* | <PlatformAvailability claudeApiBeta claudePlatformAwsBeta /> |
| [Structured outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) | Guarantee schema conformance with two approaches: JSON outputs for structured data responses, and strict tool use for validated tool inputs. | [ZDR eligible (qualified)](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs#data-retention)* | <PlatformAvailability claudeApi claudePlatformAws bedrock vertexAi azureAiBeta /> |

Only JSON schemas are cached, for up to 24 hours since last use. **Web search and web fetch:** ZDR-eligible except when [dynamic filtering](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool#dynamic-filtering) is enabled. **Fallback credit and server-side fallback:** The features retain no message content, but both handle refusals from Claude Fable 5, which [is not available under ZDR](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention#model-specific-data-retention-requirements). See [ZDR details](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention#feature-eligibility).
