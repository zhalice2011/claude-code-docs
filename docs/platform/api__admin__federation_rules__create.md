# Create Federation Rule

**POST** `/v1/organizations/federation_rules`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api).

Create a federation rule owned by your organization.

The referenced issuer and the target service account must already exist
in the same organization; invalid references are rejected with a 400
error. The workspace reference is validated. Membership is not checked
at rule creation: token exchange resolves a single enabled workspace per
call and is rejected unless the target service account is a member of
that workspace (it is implicitly a member of the default workspace).
Rules on well-known shared issuers (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Buildkite,
Terraform Cloud, Google) must constrain tenant identity via an
identity-bearing claim, a tenant-pinning subject prefix (such as
`repo:YOUR_ORG/...`), or a CEL condition referencing one of those
identity claims (e.g. `claims.repository_owner`). OAuth callers may only
manage rules whose `oauth_scope` is `workspace:developer` or
`workspace:inference`; other scopes require a Console session.

## Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

## Body parameters

- `issuer_id: string`

  Tagged ID of the federation issuer.

- `match: object`

  Conditions the verified JWT must satisfy for this rule to apply. At least one of `subject_prefix` (other than a wildcard-only value like `*`), `claims`, or `condition` is required; `audience` alone is not sufficient.

  - `audience: optional string or null`

    Exact match against the `aud` claim (any element if array). When omitted, the JWT's `aud` must still equal Anthropic's expected audience for the issuer; setting this field overrides that default.

    maxLength: 1024

  - `claims: optional map[string] or null`

    Exact-match `{claim: value}` pairs against top-level claims. Only string-valued claims can be matched; use `condition` for non-string claims.

  - `condition: optional string or null`

    CEL expression over claims for logic the structural fields can't express. Must evaluate to a boolean and may reference only the `claims` variable; a constant-true expression (such as `true`) is rejected with 400.

    maxLength: 4096

  - `subject_prefix: optional string or null`

    Match the verified JWT `sub` claim. Exact match unless the value ends with `*`, in which case it is a prefix match. Example: `repo:my-org/my-repo:ref:refs/heads/main`.

    maxLength: 1024

- `name: string`

  Slug identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens). Unique within the organization; a duplicate name returns 409.

  maxLength: 255, minLength: 1

- `oauth_scope: string`

  Space-separated OAuth scopes. OAuth callers may only set `workspace:developer` or `workspace:inference`; other scopes (such as `org:admin`) require a Console session.

  minLength: 1

- `target: object`

  Identity that tokens minted via this rule act as. Currently always a `service_account` target.

  - `service_account_id: string`

    Tagged ID of the service account to mint tokens for.

  - `type: "service_account"`

  - `service_account_name: optional string or null`

    Service account's display name at read time. Ignored on writes.

- `applies_to_all_workspaces: optional boolean`

  When true, enable this rule for every workspace in the org (including workspaces created later).

- `attributes: optional map[string] or null`

  CEL expressions `{name: expr}` extracting named values from claims. Not yet supported; any non-empty value is rejected with 400.

- `description: optional string or null`

  Optional free-text description.

  maxLength: 2000

- `token_lifetime_seconds: optional number`

  Lifetime in seconds for access tokens minted via this rule (60-86400). Defaults to 3600 (1h). Minted tokens are capped at `max(60, min(this value, 2 × remaining assertion validity))` seconds.

  maximum: 86400, minimum: 60

- `workspace_id: optional string or null`

  Tagged ID of the workspace to enable this rule for. Required unless `applies_to_all_workspaces` is true. Additional workspaces can be added via the `/federation_rules/{federation_rule_id}/workspaces` sub-resource.

## Returns

- `FederationRule object`

  Authorization rule binding an external OIDC identity to Anthropic.

  Evaluates the match conditions and mints an OAuth access token for the
  resolved target, scoped to a single workspace where the rule is enabled
  (chosen by the caller at exchange time when the rule is enabled for more
  than one). For rules enabled via `workspace_ids` or
  `applies_to_all_workspaces`, the target service account must be a member
  of that workspace (it is implicitly a member of the default workspace);
  rules carrying only the legacy `workspace_id` binding do not enforce
  this.

  - `id: string`

    Tagged ID of the federation rule.

  - `applies_to_all_workspaces: boolean`

    When true, this rule is enabled for every workspace in the org (including ones created after the rule). `workspace_ids` is ignored at exchange time.

  - `archived_at: string or null`

    If set, this rule is archived and rejects token exchange.

    format: date-time

  - `archived_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this rule.

  - `attributes: map[string] or null`

    CEL expressions extracting named values from claims. Not yet supported; always null.

  - `created_at: string`

    When this rule was created.

    format: date-time

  - `created_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this rule.

  - `description: string or null`

    Optional free-text description.

  - `issuer_id: string`

    Tagged ID of the issuer whose tokens this rule accepts.

  - `issuer_name: string or null`

    Issuer's display name at read time.

  - `match: object`

    Conditions the verified JWT must satisfy for this rule to apply. All populated matcher fields must pass.

    - `audience: optional string or null`

      Exact match against the `aud` claim (any element if array). When omitted, the JWT's `aud` must still equal Anthropic's expected audience for the issuer; setting this field overrides that default.

      maxLength: 1024

    - `claims: optional map[string] or null`

      Exact-match `{claim: value}` pairs against top-level claims. Only string-valued claims can be matched; use `condition` for non-string claims.

    - `condition: optional string or null`

      CEL expression over claims for logic the structural fields can't express. Must evaluate to a boolean and may reference only the `claims` variable; a constant-true expression (such as `true`) is rejected with 400.

      maxLength: 4096

    - `subject_prefix: optional string or null`

      Match the verified JWT `sub` claim. Exact match unless the value ends with `*`, in which case it is a prefix match. Example: `repo:my-org/my-repo:ref:refs/heads/main`.

      maxLength: 1024

  - `name: string`

    Admin-chosen slug identifier.

  - `oauth_scope: string`

    Space-separated OAuth scopes granted on the minted token.

  - `target: object`

    Identity that tokens minted via this rule act as. Currently always a `service_account` target.

    - `service_account_id: string`

      Tagged ID of the service account to mint tokens for.

    - `type: "service_account"`

    - `service_account_name: optional string or null`

      Service account's display name at read time. Ignored on writes.

  - `token_lifetime_seconds: number`

    Lifetime in seconds of access tokens minted via this rule. Minted tokens are capped at `max(60, min(this value, 2 × remaining assertion validity))` seconds.

  - `type: "federation_rule"`

    default: federation_rule

  - `updated_at: string`

    When this rule was last updated.

    format: date-time

  - `updated_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that last updated this rule.

  - `workspace_id: string or null`

    Legacy single-workspace binding. Prefer `workspace_ids` and the `/federation_rules/{federation_rule_id}/workspaces` sub-resource for managing workspace enablement.

  - `workspace_ids: array of string`

    Tagged IDs of the workspaces this rule is enabled for. May be empty for older rules that only carry the legacy `workspace_id` binding. Ignored at exchange time when `applies_to_all_workspaces` is true (the list may still be non-empty).
