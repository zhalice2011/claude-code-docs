## Update Federation Rule

**post** `/v1/organizations/federation_rules/{federation_rule_id}`

Partially update a federation rule.

`issuer_id` is immutable. `match` and `target` are replaced as whole
objects when set. Referenced service accounts and workspaces must exist
in your organization; invalid references are rejected with a 400 error.
Archived rules cannot be updated; this returns 400. Create a new rule
instead. Rules on well-known shared issuers (GitHub Actions, GitLab,
Buildkite, Terraform Cloud, Google) must constrain tenant identity via
an identity-bearing claim, a tenant-pinning subject prefix (such as
`repo:YOUR_ORG/...`), or a CEL condition referencing one of those
identity claims (e.g. `claims.repository_owner`). On these issuers the
requirement is re-checked on every update; if an existing rule's stored
match does not yet constrain tenant identity, any update (even a rename
or description change) must also supply a conforming `match` in the same
request. OAuth callers may only manage rules whose `oauth_scope` is
`workspace:developer` or `workspace:inference`; other scopes require a
Console session. Admin API keys are not accepted.

### Path Parameters

- `federation_rule_id: string`

  ID of the federation rule to update.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Body Parameters

- `applies_to_all_workspaces: optional boolean`

  When true, enables this rule for every workspace in the org (including workspaces created later). Setting `false` is rejected with 400 if no workspace would remain enabled; a rule with only a legacy `workspace_id` binding continues to mint.

- `attributes: optional map[string]`

  Replaces the CEL expressions `{name: expr}` extracting named values from claims. Send null to clear them. Not yet supported; any non-empty value is rejected with 400.

- `description: optional string`

  Replaces the description. Omit to leave unchanged; send `null` to clear (the field is stored as an empty string).

- `match: optional object { audience, claims, condition, subject_prefix }`

  Does the incoming JWT qualify?

  All populated fields must pass; omitted fields are skipped. At least one
  of `subject_prefix` (other than a wildcard-only value like `*`), `claims`,
  or `condition` is required; `audience` alone is not sufficient.

  - `audience: optional string`

    Exact match against the `aud` claim (any element if array). When omitted, the JWT's `aud` must still equal Anthropic's expected audience for the issuer; setting this field overrides that default.

  - `claims: optional map[string]`

    Exact-match `{claim: value}` pairs against top-level claims. Only string-valued claims can be matched; use `condition` for non-string claims.

  - `condition: optional string`

    CEL expression over claims for logic the structural fields can't express. Must evaluate to a boolean and may reference only the `claims` variable; a constant-true expression (such as `true`) is rejected with 400.

  - `subject_prefix: optional string`

    Match the verified JWT `sub` claim. Exact match unless the value ends with `*`, in which case it is a prefix match. Example: `repo:my-org/my-repo:ref:refs/heads/main`.

- `name: optional string`

  Replaces the slug identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens). Unique within the organization; a duplicate name returns 409.

- `oauth_scope: optional string`

  Replaces the space-separated OAuth scopes granted on minted tokens. OAuth callers may only set `workspace:developer` or `workspace:inference`; other scopes (such as `org:admin`) require a Console session.

- `target: optional object { service_account_id, type, service_account_name }`

  Bind to a fixed service account by ID.

  - `service_account_id: string`

    Tagged ID of the service account to mint tokens for.

  - `type: "service_account"`

    - `"service_account"`

  - `service_account_name: optional string`

    Service account's display name at read time. Ignored on writes.

- `token_lifetime_seconds: optional number`

  Replaces the lifetime in seconds for access tokens minted via this rule (60-86400). Minted tokens are capped at `max(60, min(this value, 2 × remaining assertion validity))` seconds.

- `workspace_id: optional string`

  Replaces the existing single workspace enablement (the previous one is removed). Rejected with 400 if the rule is enabled for more than one workspace; use the `/federation_rules/{federation_rule_id}/workspaces` sub-resource instead.

### Returns

- `FederationRule object { id, applies_to_all_workspaces, archived_at, 17 more }`

  Authorization rule binding an external OIDC identity to Anthropic.

  Evaluates the match conditions and mints an OAuth access token for the
  resolved target, scoped to a single workspace where the rule is enabled
  (chosen by the caller at exchange time when the rule is enabled for more
  than one). For rules enabled via `workspace_ids` or
  `applies_to_all_workspaces`, the target service account must be a member
  of that workspace (it is implicitly a member of the default workspace);
  rules carrying only the legacy `workspace_id` binding do not enforce
  this.

  - `id: string`

    Tagged ID of the federation rule.

  - `applies_to_all_workspaces: boolean`

    When true, this rule is enabled for every workspace in the org (including ones created after the rule). `workspace_ids` is ignored at exchange time.

  - `archived_at: string`

    If set, this rule is archived and rejects token exchange.

  - `archived_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this rule.

  - `attributes: map[string]`

    CEL expressions extracting named values from claims. Not yet supported; always null.

  - `created_at: string`

    When this rule was created.

  - `created_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this rule.

  - `description: string`

    Optional free-text description.

  - `issuer_id: string`

    Tagged ID of the issuer whose tokens this rule accepts.

  - `issuer_name: string`

    Issuer's display name at read time.

  - `match: object { audience, claims, condition, subject_prefix }`

    Conditions the verified JWT must satisfy for this rule to apply. All populated matcher fields must pass.

    - `audience: optional string`

      Exact match against the `aud` claim (any element if array). When omitted, the JWT's `aud` must still equal Anthropic's expected audience for the issuer; setting this field overrides that default.

    - `claims: optional map[string]`

      Exact-match `{claim: value}` pairs against top-level claims. Only string-valued claims can be matched; use `condition` for non-string claims.

    - `condition: optional string`

      CEL expression over claims for logic the structural fields can't express. Must evaluate to a boolean and may reference only the `claims` variable; a constant-true expression (such as `true`) is rejected with 400.

    - `subject_prefix: optional string`

      Match the verified JWT `sub` claim. Exact match unless the value ends with `*`, in which case it is a prefix match. Example: `repo:my-org/my-repo:ref:refs/heads/main`.

  - `name: string`

    Admin-chosen slug identifier.

  - `oauth_scope: string`

    Space-separated OAuth scopes granted on the minted token.

  - `target: object { service_account_id, type, service_account_name }`

    Identity that tokens minted via this rule act as. Currently always a `service_account` target.

    - `service_account_id: string`

      Tagged ID of the service account to mint tokens for.

    - `type: "service_account"`

      - `"service_account"`

    - `service_account_name: optional string`

      Service account's display name at read time. Ignored on writes.

  - `token_lifetime_seconds: number`

    Lifetime in seconds of access tokens minted via this rule. Minted tokens are capped at `max(60, min(this value, 2 × remaining assertion validity))` seconds.

  - `type: "federation_rule"`

    - `"federation_rule"`

  - `updated_at: string`

    When this rule was last updated.

  - `updated_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that last updated this rule.

  - `workspace_id: string`

    Legacy single-workspace binding. Prefer `workspace_ids` and the `/federation_rules/{federation_rule_id}/workspaces` sub-resource for managing workspace enablement.

  - `workspace_ids: array of string`

    Tagged IDs of the workspaces this rule is enabled for. May be empty for older rules that only carry the legacy `workspace_id` binding. Ignored at exchange time when `applies_to_all_workspaces` is true (the list may still be non-empty).
