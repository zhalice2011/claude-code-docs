# Workspaces

## Add Workspace To Service Account

**post** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces`

Add a service account to a workspace with the given `workspace_role`.

Mirror of `POST /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts`, addressed
from the service-account side; both create the same membership. If the
service account is already an explicit member of the workspace, its
`workspace_role` is replaced with the value supplied here. Archived
workspaces return 400. Archived service accounts cannot be added and are
rejected. Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys
are not accepted.

### Path Parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Body Parameters

- `workspace_id: string`

  Tagged workspace ID to add the service account to.

- `workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_developer" or "workspace_restricted_developer" or "workspace_user"`

  Role to assign to the service account in this workspace.

  - `"workspace_admin"`

  - `"workspace_developer"`

  - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

  - `"workspace_user"`

### Returns

- `created_by_actor_id: string`

  Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

- `implicit: boolean`

  True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role workspace_user and cannot be removed.

- `service_account_id: string`

  Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

- `type: "service_account_workspace_member"`

  - `"service_account_workspace_member"`

- `workspace_id: string`

  Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

- `workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_billing" or "workspace_developer" or 2 more`

  Role of the service account in this workspace. Service accounts cannot hold the `workspace_billing` role.

  - `"workspace_admin"`

  - `"workspace_billing"`

  - `"workspace_developer"`

  - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

  - `"workspace_user"`

### Example

```http
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/service_accounts/$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID/workspaces \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN" \
    -d '{
          "workspace_id": "workspace_id",
          "workspace_role": "workspace_admin"
        }'
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "created_by_actor_id": "created_by_actor_id",
  "implicit": true,
  "service_account_id": "service_account_id",
  "type": "service_account_workspace_member",
  "workspace_id": "workspace_id",
  "workspace_role": "workspace_admin"
}
```

## List Workspaces For Service Account

**get** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces`

List the workspaces a service account is a member of.

Each entry includes the service account's `workspace_role` in that
workspace. Use `limit` and the `next_page` cursor to paginate. When the
service account has no explicit default-workspace membership, the
implicit (`implicit: true`) membership is returned as the first entry on
the first page; with `limit=1` the first page may return up to 2 entries
(the implicit entry plus one explicit membership) so a pagination cursor
can be derived. Memberships are returned only while
the service account is active; an archived service account returns an
empty list.

### Path Parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account.

### Query Parameters

- `limit: optional number`

  Number of results per page.

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Returns

- `data: array of object { created_by_actor_id, implicit, service_account_id, 3 more }`

  - `created_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

  - `implicit: boolean`

    True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role workspace_user and cannot be removed.

  - `service_account_id: string`

    Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

  - `type: "service_account_workspace_member"`

    - `"service_account_workspace_member"`

  - `workspace_id: string`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

  - `workspace_role: "workspace_admin" or "workspace_billing" or "workspace_developer" or 2 more`

    Role of the service account in this workspace. Service accounts cannot hold the `workspace_billing` role.

    - `"workspace_admin"`

    - `"workspace_billing"`

    - `"workspace_developer"`

    - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

    - `"workspace_user"`

- `next_page: string`

  Opaque cursor for the next page, or null if no more results.

### Example

```http
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/service_accounts/$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID/workspaces \
    -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN"
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "created_by_actor_id": "created_by_actor_id",
      "implicit": true,
      "service_account_id": "service_account_id",
      "type": "service_account_workspace_member",
      "workspace_id": "workspace_id",
      "workspace_role": "workspace_admin"
    }
  ],
  "next_page": "next_page"
}
```

## Remove Workspace From Service Account

**delete** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces/{workspace_id}`

Remove a service account from a workspace.

Mirror of `DELETE /workspaces/{workspace_id}/service_accounts/{service_account_id}`,
addressed from the service-account side. Removal is idempotent (returns
200 even if the membership was already removed). A DELETE against the
implicit default-workspace membership returns 200 but is a no-op and the
membership persists; deleting an explicit default-workspace row reverts
to the implicit `workspace_user` membership. Archived workspaces return
400. Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys are not
accepted.

### Path Parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account.

- `workspace_id: string`

  ID of the workspace.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Returns

- `service_account_id: string`

  Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`) named in the delete request. Removal is idempotent; see the endpoint description for the implicit-membership no-op.

- `type: "service_account_workspace_member_deleted"`

  - `"service_account_workspace_member_deleted"`

- `workspace_id: string`

  Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`) named in the delete request.

### Example

```http
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/service_accounts/$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID/workspaces/$WORKSPACE_ID \
    -X DELETE \
    -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN"
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "service_account_id": "service_account_id",
  "type": "service_account_workspace_member_deleted",
  "workspace_id": "workspace_id"
}
```
