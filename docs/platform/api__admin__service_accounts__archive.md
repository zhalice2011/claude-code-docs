# Archive Service Account

**POST** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/archive`

Archive a service account.

Idempotent; re-archiving returns the service account with its original
`archived_at`. Rejected with 400 if any live (non-archived) federation
rule still targets this service account, same as issuer archival; archive
those rules first or change their target to another service account.

Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys are not
accepted.

## Path parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account to archive.

## Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

## Returns

- `ServiceAccount object`

  Named non-human identity within the caller's organization.

  A service account is a pure identity: name + org. Authorization lives on
  whatever references it (federation rules).

  - `id: string`

    Tagged ID of the service account.

  - `archived_at: string or null`

    If set, this service account is archived.

    format: date-time

  - `archived_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this service account.

  - `created_at: string`

    When this service account was created.

    format: date-time

  - `created_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this service account.

  - `description: string or null`

    Optional free-text description.

  - `name: string`

    Admin-chosen slug identifier.

  - `organization_role: "admin" or "developer"`

    Org-level role. A federation rule may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when this is `admin`. A rule granting `org:admin` whose target is later demoted to `developer` is rejected at token exchange. Rules granting `org:admin` are managed in the Console.

    - `"admin"`

    - `"developer"`

  - `type: "service_account"`

    default: service_account

  - `updated_at: string`

    When this service account was last updated.

    format: date-time

  - `updated_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that last updated this service account.
