# Spend Limits API

Set a spend limit on each Claude Enterprise member, see where each member's spend limit is inherited from, and review or act on members' requests for a higher limit.

---

The Spend Limits API lets you set a spend limit on each Claude Enterprise member, see where each member's spend limit is inherited from, and review or act on members' requests for a higher limit.

For per-user and time-bucketed usage and cost *reporting*, see [Analytics APIs](/docs/en/manage-claude/analytics-api).

  **Scoped Admin API key required**

  These endpoints require an Admin API key with the `read:spend_limits` scope (for `GET` endpoints) or the `write:spend_limits` scope (for `POST` and `DELETE` endpoints). See [Create an Admin API key](/docs/en/manage-claude/admin-api-keys#create-a-key-for-a-claude-enterprise-organization) for where your primary owner creates one and which scopes to select. Pass the key in the `x-api-key` header on every request.

<Note>
  The Spend Limits API is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform (Claude Console) organizations.

## Overview

The API exposes eight endpoints across two resources:

| Resource | Endpoints | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **Spend limits** | `GET /v1/organizations/spend_limits/effective`<br/>`GET /v1/organizations/spend_limits/{spend_limit_id}`<br/>`POST /v1/organizations/spend_limits`<br/>`DELETE /v1/organizations/spend_limits/{spend_limit_id}` | Read each member's effective spend limit and period-to-date spend; set or clear a per-user override. |
| **Spend limit increase requests** | `GET /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests`<br/>`GET /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{id}`<br/>`POST /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{id}/approve`<br/>`POST /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{id}/deny` | List members' requests for a higher spend limit, with the context needed to decide; approve or deny each request. |

Use the **spend limits** endpoints to answer "what spend limit applies to each member, where does it come from, and how close are they to it?" and to set a per-user override. Use the **spend limit increase requests** endpoints to work the queue of member-submitted requests.

## Prerequisites

- Your organization must be on a Claude Enterprise plan.
- Usage credits must be turned on for your organization. Your primary owner can turn them on in claude.ai billing settings.

## Quick start

List every member's effective monthly spend limit and period-to-date spend:

```bash cURL
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limits/effective?limit=20" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

## Key concepts

### The spend limit hierarchy

An **effective spend limit** applies to each member's spend, resolved from a hierarchy of scope levels. When a member has no per-user override, they inherit the spend limit configured for their group (if your organization uses group-based limits), their seat tier, or the organization-wide default. A group spend limit is a per-member default: each member inheriting it is gated against their own spend, not a pooled group budget.

Reading `GET /v1/organizations/spend_limits/effective` returns every current member with their resolved effective spend limit, where that limit was resolved from (`source`), and their period-to-date spend. Setting a per-user override with `POST /v1/organizations/spend_limits` pins a member to a specific spend limit regardless of what they would otherwise inherit. Deleting the override returns them to the inherited spend limit (or leaves them unlimited if none exists).

The `source` field on each member's row tells you which level their spend limit resolved from: `user` (a per-user override), `seat_tier`, `rbac_group`, or `organization`. Treat scope types as an open set; fall through on unknown values rather than failing.

### Period

`period` is the recurring window over which the spend limit is enforced and spend resets. A spend limit is identified by its `(scope, period)` pair. Currently `monthly` is the only supported period; monthly spend resets at 00:00 UTC on the first of each calendar month. Treat `period` as an open set.

### Amounts and currency

All monetary values are strings in **minor units of the organization's billing currency** (cents, for USD). For example, `"50000"` represents 500.00 USD. Parse as a decimal and divide by 100 to display dollars; avoid binary floating-point for large values.

`amount` is **nullable**. In a member's effective row, `null` means **unlimited** (no spend limit) and `"0"` means the member cannot use Claude beyond their plan's included usage. On a configured spend-limit row (as returned by `GET /v1/organizations/spend_limits/{id}`), `null` only means no numeric spend limit is set; read the member's effective row to distinguish unlimited from included-usage-only.

`period_to_date_spend` is the member's spend accrued since the start of the current `period`, in the same minor-unit format; it may include a fractional part (for example, `"41280.125"`). It may read as `"0"` if the spend reading is temporarily unavailable; treat it as informational, not transactional.

### Increase request lifecycle

A **spend limit increase request** is created when a member clicks **Request more usage** in claude.ai. Requests are not created through this API. A request's `status` is one of:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Awaiting admin action. The request normally carries a live `spend_summary` so you can see the member's current effective spend limit and period-to-date spend while deciding; `spend_summary` may be `null` if it could not be computed. |
| `approved` | The request was resolved with approval: either an admin approved it explicitly, another admin action raised the member's spend limit, or Anthropic support raised a spend limit on the organization's behalf. `spend_summary` is `null`. |
| `denied` | An admin declined. `spend_summary` is `null`. claude.ai hides that member's request button for 30 days from `resolved_at`; an admin can still raise the member's spend limit directly at any time. |

Both `approved` and `denied` are terminal. A member has at most one `pending` request at a time.

Approving with `POST /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{id}/approve` writes the same per-user spend limit row that `POST /v1/organizations/spend_limits` writes. Setting a spend limit directly does **not** transition a pending request; use the approve endpoint to resolve a request.

By default, Anthropic emails the member when their request is approved or denied. Pass `suppress_notification: true` on approve or deny to suppress that email (for example, when your own system notifies the member).

## Rate limiting

All eight endpoints share a single per-organization limit of **60 requests per minute**. Requests over the limit return **429 Too Many Requests**.

## Pagination

`GET /v1/organizations/spend_limits/effective` and `GET /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests` are paginated with an **opaque cursor**. The first request returns up to `limit` rows plus a `next_page` cursor; pass that cursor unchanged as the `page` parameter on the next request, and repeat until `next_page` is `null`.

**Do not change query parameters mid-sequence.** Cursors are bound to the filters that issued them. If you change `user_ids[]`, `period[]`, `status[]`, or `actor_ids[]` and pass an old cursor, you'll get a 400 with *"cursor does not match current query parameters"*. Start a new sequence from the first page instead.

## Serializing list parameters

List parameters use bracket notation: repeat the parameter name with `[]` for each value.

```text
user_ids[]=user_01AbCdEfGh&user_ids[]=user_01JkLmNoPq
```

## Error responses

Error responses follow the standard shape documented in [Errors](/docs/en/api/errors). Quote the `request_id` from the response body when contacting support.

## Spend limits

### List each member's effective spend limit

`GET /v1/organizations/spend_limits/effective` returns one row per current member, reflecting each member's effective spend limit, its `source` in the scope hierarchy, and their `period_to_date_spend`. Requires the `read:spend_limits` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [List effective spend limits](/docs/en/api/admin/spend_limits/list_effective) in the API reference.

```bash cURL
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limits/effective?limit=20" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "scope": { "type": "user", "user_id": "user_01AbCdEfGh" },
      "actor": {
        "type": "user_actor",
        "user_id": "user_01AbCdEfGh",
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "email_address": "jane@example.com",
        "deleted": false
      },
      "amount": "50000",
      "currency": "USD",
      "period": "monthly",
      "source": { "type": "seat_tier", "seat_tier": "enterprise_standard" },
      "spend_limit_id": "spl_01XyZaBcDeFgHiJkLmNoPq",
      "period_to_date_spend": "31402.5"
    }
  ],
  "next_page": "page_..."
}
```

### Get a single spend limit

`GET /v1/organizations/spend_limits/{spend_limit_id}` returns one configured spend limit by ID. Use it to inspect the row that a `spend_limit_id` field referenced. Requires the `read:spend_limits` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Retrieve a spend limit](/docs/en/api/admin/spend_limits/retrieve) in the API reference.

```bash cURL
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limits/spl_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

### Set a per-user override

`POST /v1/organizations/spend_limits` sets a per-user spend limit override. This is an upsert keyed on `(scope, period)`: setting a limit for a user and period that already has one overwrites it in place. This endpoint accepts only `scope.type: "user"`; seat-tier, group, and organization-level defaults are configured in claude.ai settings. Requires the `write:spend_limits` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Create a spend limit](/docs/en/api/admin/spend_limits/create) in the API reference.

```bash cURL
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limits" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"scope": {"type": "user", "user_id": "user_01AbCdEfGh"}, "amount": "75000"}'
```

```json
{
  "type": "spend_limit",
  "id": "spl_01RsTuVwXyZaBcDeFgHiJk",
  "created_at": "2026-05-11T10:02:44Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-05-11T10:02:44Z",
  "scope": { "type": "user", "user_id": "user_01AbCdEfGh" },
  "amount": "75000",
  "currency": "USD",
  "period": "monthly"
}
```

### Remove a per-user override

`DELETE /v1/organizations/spend_limits/{spend_limit_id}` removes a per-user override, after which the member falls back to any inherited seat-tier, group, or organization default. Seat-tier, group, and organization-level rows cannot be deleted through this endpoint. Requires the `write:spend_limits` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Delete a spend limit](/docs/en/api/admin/spend_limits/delete) in the API reference.

```bash cURL
curl --request DELETE "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limits/spl_01RsTuVwXyZaBcDeFgHiJk" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

## Spend limit increase requests

### List increase requests

`GET /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests` lists requests, most recent first. Filter by `status[]` (`pending`, `approved`, `denied`) and `actor_ids[]`. The list excludes requests whose requester is no longer a member of the organization. Requires the `read:spend_limits` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [List spend limit increase requests](/docs/en/api/admin/spend_limits/increase_requests/list) in the API reference.

```bash cURL
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests?status[]=pending&limit=50" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

Each pending request carries a live `spend_summary` showing the requester's current effective spend limit and period-to-date spend, enough to decide without a separate lookup.

### Get a single increase request

`GET /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{id}` returns one request by ID. Requires the `read:spend_limits` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Retrieve a spend limit increase request](/docs/en/api/admin/spend_limits/increase_requests/retrieve) in the API reference.

```bash cURL
curl "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/slir_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY"
```

### Approve an increase request

`POST /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{id}/approve` approves a pending request: it writes a per-user spend limit at the admin-supplied `amount` for the requester and transitions the request to `approved`. The request does not carry a requested amount; you supply the new spend limit on approval. Requires the `write:spend_limits` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Approve a spend limit increase request](/docs/en/api/admin/spend_limits/increase_requests/approve) in the API reference.

```bash cURL
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/slir_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt/approve" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"amount": "75000", "suppress_notification": true}'
```

### Deny an increase request

`POST /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{id}/deny` denies a pending request. Idempotent on `denied`: denying an already-denied request returns 200 with the existing resource. The endpoint rejects an attempt to deny an already-approved request so automation can distinguish a retry from a conflicting decision. Requires the `write:spend_limits` scope.

For complete parameter details and response schemas, see [Deny a spend limit increase request](/docs/en/api/admin/spend_limits/increase_requests/deny) in the API reference.

```bash cURL
curl --request POST "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/slir_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrSt/deny" \
  --header "content-type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" \
  --data '{"suppress_notification": true}'
```

## Frequently asked questions

### Does setting a spend limit directly resolve a member's pending increase request?

No. `POST /v1/organizations/spend_limits` writes the override but leaves the pending request untouched. Use `POST /v1/organizations/spend_limit_increase_requests/{id}/approve` to resolve the request and write the override in one call.

### What happens when I delete a per-user override?

The member falls back to whatever they'd inherit from the hierarchy: their group, seat-tier, or organization default. If no default exists at any level, the member is unlimited.

### Can I set a seat-tier or organization-wide default through this API?

No. Only per-user overrides can be written through this API. Seat-tier, group, and organization-level defaults are configured in claude.ai Organization settings.

### Why does `period_to_date_spend` sometimes read as `"0"` for an active member?

The spend reading can be temporarily unavailable, in which case the field reads `"0"` rather than erroring. Treat it as informational.
