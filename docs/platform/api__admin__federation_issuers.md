# Federation Issuers

## Create Federation Issuer

**POST** `/v1/organizations/federation_issuers`

Register an OIDC issuer that Anthropic will trust for workload identity
federation in your organization.

The `jwks` field controls how the issuer's signing keys are obtained and
takes one of three shapes selected by `type`: `discovery` (resolve keys
through OIDC discovery), `explicit_url` (fetch keys from a fixed JWKS
URL), or `inline` (provide a static key set). When `jwks.type` is
`discovery` and no `discovery_base` is set, the issuer URL must be
publicly reachable over HTTPS so Anthropic can fetch the discovery
document; for `explicit_url` and `inline` modes the issuer URL is only
matched as the JWT's `iss` claim and is not fetched.

Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys are not
accepted.

### Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Body parameters

- `issuer_url: string`

  The `iss` claim value to match against.

  minLength: 1

- `name: string`

  Slug identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens). Unique within the organization; a duplicate name returns 409.

  maxLength: 255, minLength: 1

- `check_jti: optional boolean or null`

  Whether the jwt-bearer exchange enforces JTI single-use (replay protection) for tokens from this issuer. Defaults to true. Applies only to assertions carrying a `jti` claim; tokens without one are accepted without single-use enforcement.

- `jwks: optional object or object or object`

  How signing keys are obtained. Defaults to OIDC discovery.

  - `Discovery object`

    JWKS via the issuer's OIDC discovery document.

    - `type: "discovery"`

    - `ca_cert_pem: optional string or null`

      Optional custom CA (PEM) for TLS verification of the JWKS fetch.

      maxLength: 8192

    - `discovery_base: optional string or null`

      Set when the discovery URL differs from `issuer_url`.

  - `ExplicitURL object`

    JWKS fetched from a fixed endpoint.

    - `type: "explicit_url"`

    - `url: string`

      JWKS endpoint.

      minLength: 1

    - `ca_cert_pem: optional string or null`

      Optional custom CA (PEM) for TLS verification of the JWKS fetch.

      maxLength: 8192

  - `Inline object`

    JWKS supplied directly; no network fetch.

    - `keys: array of map[unknown]`

      Inline JWK objects.

      minItems: 1

    - `type: "inline"`

- `max_jwt_lifetime_seconds: optional number or null`

  Maximum allowed iat→exp spread for assertions from this issuer (1-176400 seconds, i.e. up to 49h). Defaults to 3600 (1h). Assertions must carry both `iat` and `exp`; a missing `iat` is rejected.

  maximum: 176400, exclusiveMinimum: 0

### Returns

  Records an external IdP the organization trusts for the RFC 7523
  jwt-bearer grant. The `issuer_url` must match the JWT `iss` claim exactly.

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this issuer.

  - `check_jti: boolean`

## Update Federation Issuer

**POST** `/v1/organizations/federation_issuers/{federation_issuer_id}`

Partially update a federation issuer.

Setting `jwks` replaces the full JWKS shape at once. Archived issuers
cannot be updated; this returns 400. Create a new issuer instead.

Updating an issuer that backs a rule with a scope outside
`workspace:developer` or `workspace:inference` requires a Console
session. Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys
are not accepted.

### Path parameters

- `federation_issuer_id: string`

  ID of the federation issuer to update.

### Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Body parameters

- `check_jti: optional boolean or null`

  Whether the jwt-bearer exchange enforces JTI single-use (replay protection) for tokens from this issuer. Applies only to assertions carrying a `jti` claim; tokens without one are accepted without single-use enforcement.

- `issuer_url: optional string or null`

  Replaces the `iss` claim value to match against. For discovery-mode issuers without a `discovery_base`, this is also the URL Anthropic fetches the OIDC discovery document and signing keys from, so changing it repoints the JWKS source. Changing the issuer URL to a well-known shared platform is rejected while any live rule under this issuer would not constrain tenant identity.

  minLength: 1

- `jwks: optional object or object or object or null`

  Replaces the entire JWKS configuration.

  - `Discovery object`

    JWKS via the issuer's OIDC discovery document.

    - `type: "discovery"`

    - `ca_cert_pem: optional string or null`

      Optional custom CA (PEM) for TLS verification of the JWKS fetch.

      maxLength: 8192

    - `discovery_base: optional string or null`

      Set when the discovery URL differs from `issuer_url`.

  - `ExplicitURL object`

    JWKS fetched from a fixed endpoint.

    - `type: "explicit_url"`

    - `url: string`

      JWKS endpoint.

      minLength: 1

    - `ca_cert_pem: optional string or null`

      Optional custom CA (PEM) for TLS verification of the JWKS fetch.

      maxLength: 8192

  - `Inline object`

    JWKS supplied directly; no network fetch.

    - `keys: array of map[unknown]`

      Inline JWK objects.

      minItems: 1

    - `type: "inline"`

- `jwks_polling_disabled: optional boolean or null`

  Only `false` is accepted, to re-enable polling after the system pauses it. Polling is paused automatically; sending `true` is rejected.

- `max_jwt_lifetime_seconds: optional number or null`

  Maximum allowed iat→exp spread for assertions from this issuer (1-176400 seconds, i.e. up to 49h). Assertions must carry both `iat` and `exp`; a missing `iat` is rejected.

  maximum: 176400, exclusiveMinimum: 0

- `name: optional string or null`

  Replaces the slug identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens). Unique within the organization; a duplicate name returns 409.

  maxLength: 255, minLength: 1

### Returns

- `FederationIssuer object`

  Registered external OIDC identity provider.

  Records an external IdP the organization trusts for the RFC 7523
  jwt-bearer grant. The `issuer_url` must match the JWT `iss` claim exactly.

  - `id: string`

    When this issuer was created.

    format: date-time

  - `created_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this issuer.

  - `issuer_url: string`

    The `iss` claim value. Incoming JWTs must match exactly.

## Archive Federation Issuer

**POST** `/v1/organizations/federation_issuers/{federation_issuer_id}/archive`

Archive a federation issuer.

Idempotent; re-archiving returns the issuer with its original
`archived_at`. Rejected with 400 if any live (non-archived) federation
rule still references the issuer; archive those rules first (a rule's
issuer cannot be changed), or recreate them against another issuer.

Requires an OAuth bearer or Console session; Admin API keys are not
accepted.

### Path parameters

- `federation_issuer_id: string`

  ID of the federation issuer to archive.

### Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Returns

- `FederationIssuer object`

  Registered external OIDC identity provider.

  Records an external IdP the organization trusts for the RFC 7523
  jwt-bearer grant. The `issuer_url` must match the JWT `iss` claim exactly.

  - `id: string`

    Tagged ID of the federation issuer.

  - `archived_at: string or null`

    If set, all rules referencing this issuer reject token exchange.

    format: date-time

  - `archived_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this issuer.

  - `check_jti: boolean`

    Whether the jwt-bearer exchange enforces JTI single-use (replay protection) for tokens from this issuer. Applies only to assertions carrying a `jti` claim; tokens without one are accepted without single-use enforcement.

  - `created_at: string`

    When this issuer was created.

    format: date-time

  - `created_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this issuer.

  - `issuer_url: string`

    The `iss` claim value. Incoming JWTs must match exactly.

  - `jwks: object or object or object`
