# List Files

**GET** `/v1/files`

List Files

## Query parameters

- `ids: optional array of string`

  Restrict the result set to Files whose `id` is in this list. At most 100 entries (after de-duplication). Mutually exclusive with `page` and `limit`. When supplied, the response is always a single page (`next_page` is null). IDs that do not resolve to a visible File — including deleted Files — are silently omitted.

- `limit: optional number`

  Number of items to return per page.

  Defaults to `20`. Ranges from `1` to `1000`.

  default: 20, maximum: 1000, minimum: 1

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque page cursor returned in a prior list response's `next_page`. Prefixed `page_`.

## Returns

- `data: array of FileMetadata`

  List of file metadata objects.

  - `id: string`

    Unique object identifier.

    The format and length of IDs may change over time.

  - `created_at: string`

    RFC 3339 datetime string representing when the file was created.

    format: date-time

  - `filename: string`

    Original filename of the uploaded file.

    maxLength: 500, minLength: 1

  - `mime_type: string`

    MIME type of the file.

    maxLength: 255, minLength: 1

  - `size_bytes: number`

    Size of the file in bytes.

    minimum: 0

  - `type: "file"`

    Object type.

    For files, this is always `"file"`.

  - `downloadable: optional boolean`

    Whether the file can be downloaded.

    default: false

  - `expires_at: optional string or null`

    RFC 3339 datetime string representing when the file will expire and become unavailable for download. Null if the file does not expire. For files uploaded with `expires_in_seconds`, this is the upload time plus that value.

    format: date-time

- `next_page: optional string or null`

  Opaque cursor for the next page. Supply as `?page=` to fetch the next page; null when there are no more results.

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/files \
