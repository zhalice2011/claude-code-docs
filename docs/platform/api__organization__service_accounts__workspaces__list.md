# List Workspaces For Service Account

**GET** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}/workspaces`

**Requires an OAuth access token with the `org:admin` scope**, from `ant auth login --scope org:admin` or a workload identity federation rule; Admin API keys are not accepted. See [Manage WIF with the Admin API](/docs/en/manage-claude/wif-admin-api).

List the workspaces a service account is a member of.

Each entry includes the service account's `workspace_role` in that
workspace. Use `limit` and the `next_page` cursor to paginate. When the
service account has no explicit default-workspace membership, the
implicit (`implicit: true`) membership is returned as the first entry on
the first page; with `limit=1` the first page may return up to 2 entries
(the implicit entry plus one explicit membership) so a pagination cursor
can be derived. Memberships are returned only while
the service account is active. Without a `page` cursor, an archived
service account returns an empty list. A `page` cursor that does not
match an active membership returns a 400 invalid-request error. A cursor
stops matching when the membership is removed, the workspace is deleted,
or the service account is archived. Restart pagination from the first
page to recover.

## Path parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account.

## Query parameters

- `limit: optional number`

  Number of results per page.

  default: 20, minimum: 1, maximum: 100

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page`.

## Headers

- `"anthropic-version": optional string`

  The version of the Claude API you want to use.

## Returns

- `data: array of ServiceAccountWorkspaceMember`

  - `type: "service_account_workspace_member"`

    default: service_account_workspace_member

  - `created_by_actor_id: string or null`

    Tagged ID (`user_...`/`svac_...`) of the actor who created this membership.

  - `implicit: boolean or null`

    True when this is the implicit default-workspace membership every service account has when no explicit membership exists. Implicit memberships have role `workspace_user` and cannot be removed.

  - `service_account_id: string`

    Tagged service account ID (`svac_...`).

  - `workspace_id: string`

    Tagged workspace ID (`wrkspc_...`).

  - `workspace_role: WorkspaceRole`

    Role of the service account in this workspace. Service accounts cannot hold the `workspace_billing` role.

    - `"workspace_admin"`

    - `"workspace_billing"`

    - `"workspace_developer"`

    - `"workspace_restricted_developer"`

    - `"workspace_user"`

- `next_page: string or null`

  Opaque cursor for the next page, or null if no more results.
