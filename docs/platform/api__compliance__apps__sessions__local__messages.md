# Messages

## Retrieve local session messages

**get** `/v1/compliance/apps/sessions/local/{local_session_id}/messages`

Read one local session's transcript, oldest-first by default.

Retention is enforced read-side: turns at or before the child
organization's retention boundary are never returned; a session
that straddles the boundary carries one leading
`content_unavailable` placeholder (`reason: "retention_elapsed"`)
in their place. The boundary is pinned on the walk's first page and
honored for 24 hours: a cursor older than that is rejected with an
explicit 400; restart the walk to read under the current boundary.

### Path Parameters

- `local_session_id: string`

### Query Parameters

- `limit: optional number`

  Maximum results (default: 100, max: 1000)

- `order: optional "asc" or "desc"`

  Sort direction. `asc` (oldest-first, default) or `desc`.

  - `"asc"`

  - `"desc"`

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque pagination token from a previous response's `next_page` field. Pass this to retrieve the next page of results. Clients should treat this value as an opaque string and not attempt to parse or interpret its contents, as the format may change without notice.

- `tool_result_max_bytes: optional number`

  Truncate each text item inside a tool result to at most this many bytes (cut on a code-point boundary). Pass `-1` to request the server maximum (approximately 1 MiB); larger values are clamped to it. `0` is not a valid value.

- `tool_use_input_max_bytes: optional number`

  Truncate each tool-use input to at most this many bytes (cut on a code-point boundary so the result is valid UTF-8). Pass `-1` to request the server maximum (approximately 1 MiB); larger values are clamped to it. `0` is not a valid value.

### Header Parameters

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

### Returns

- `data: array of object { id, content, created_at, 3 more }`

  Transcript turns for this page, ordered by `created_at` in the direction selected by the `order` parameter (ascending by default). Turns sharing a `created_at` (all messages of one inference call carry the call's timestamp) are returned in transcript order.

  - `id: string`

    Message identifier, prefixed `clsm_`. Stable for as long as the message's turn is retained: identifiers of retained turns do not change as older turns age out of the organization's retention period. The `retention_elapsed` placeholder's identifier is distinct from every retained turn's and changes only when further turns age out.

  - `content: array of object { text, truncated, type }  or object { id, input, name, 2 more }  or object { content, is_error, name, 3 more }`

    Content blocks within the message, discriminated on `type` (`text` / `tool_use` / `tool_result`: the same discriminator values as the claude.ai chat-messages endpoint; the tool variants omit `integration_name` and `mcp_server_url`, and `text` carries `truncated`). Extended-thinking content is never included. The request's `system` field is never included; a presence-only marker message is emitted when it was set. The request's `tools[]` definitions are never included as transcript messages. Project-level instructions (such as CLAUDE.md files) appear in the message stream as a user-role context block and are included. Empty when `provenance.type` is `content_unavailable`.

    - `Text object { text, truncated, type }`

      Text content block.

      - `text: string`

        Text content from the user or the assistant

      - `truncated: boolean`

        True when `text` was shortened by the server's fixed per-string bound (approximately 1 MiB), or when ancillary content the block carried (such as citations) was omitted, or when this block stands in for a non-text block whose content is not shown, or when it is an explanatory marker the server inserted (its text enclosed in square brackets, e.g. prefacing client-asserted history). There is no request parameter that raises the per-string bound.

      - `type: "text"`

        - `"text"`

    - `ToolUse object { id, input, name, 2 more }`

      Tool invocation requested by the assistant.

      - `id: string or null`

        Tool-use ID, e.g. 'toolu_01AbC...'

      - `input: string`

        Arguments passed to the tool, as a JSON-encoded string. May be shortened (see the `truncated` field); a truncated value is cut mid-document and is not valid JSON.

      - `name: string`

        Name of the tool invoked

      - `truncated: boolean`

        True when `input` was shortened. Pass `tool_use_input_max_bytes=-1` to request the server maximum.

      - `type: "tool_use"`

        - `"tool_use"`

    - `ToolResult object { content, is_error, name, 3 more }`

      Result returned by a tool invocation.

      - `content: array of object { text, type }`

        Text content returned by the tool. Non-text item types are omitted and signalled via `truncated` with an in-band item-count marker.

        - `text: string`

          Text returned by the tool

        - `type: "text"`

          - `"text"`

      - `is_error: boolean`

        True when the tool reported an error

      - `name: string`

        Name of the tool that produced this result

      - `tool_use_id: string or null`

        ID of the tool_use block this result responds to

      - `truncated: boolean`

        True when one or more text items in `content` were shortened or non-text items were omitted. Pass `tool_result_max_bytes=-1` to request the server maximum.

      - `type: "tool_result"`

        - `"tool_result"`

  - `created_at: string`

    When the message was recorded (RFC 3339, UTC)

  - `provenance: object { reason, type }  or object { type }  or object { type }  or null`

    Where this turn's content came from, discriminated on `type`. Null (the common case) means verified content: on an assistant message, content Claude produced during this session; on a user message, content the user sent. `content_unavailable`: the turn's content cannot be returned and `content` is empty; `reason` says why. `client_asserted`: assistant content the client supplied as conversation history; `content` shows what the model received but its authorship is not verified; never on user-role messages. `synthetic_marker`: a transcript marker the endpoint generated rather than content either party sent during the session. Both `client_asserted` and `synthetic_marker` can result from normal request or client processing, not only client modification. Callers should tolerate unrecognized `type` values.

    - `ContentUnavailable object { reason, type }`

      The turn's content cannot be returned; `content` is empty.

      - `reason: string`

        Why this turn's content cannot be returned, e.g. `not_captured` (the content was not captured for compliance retrieval), `cmek_key_revoked` (the content is encrypted under the organization's customer-managed key and that key is unavailable), `retention_elapsed` (the content lies past the organization's retention boundary; on the placeholder standing in for every pre-boundary turn), or `oversize` (the message exceeds the server's per-message size bound even after per-block truncation). Callers should tolerate unrecognized values. `not_captured` is not proof that no record was stored: content withheld by the storage layer's fail-closed access policies carries the same reason and is deliberately indistinguishable from content that was never captured.

      - `type: "content_unavailable"`

        - `"content_unavailable"`

    - `ClientAsserted object { type }`

      Assistant content the client supplied as conversation history
      rather than produced by Claude during this session. `content` shows
      what the model received but its authorship is not verified; this can
      result from normal request or client processing, not only client
      modification. Never on user-role messages.

      - `type: "client_asserted"`

        - `"client_asserted"`

    - `SyntheticMarker object { type }`

      A transcript marker generated by the endpoint rather than sent by
      either party during the session. Marker messages indicate that the
      prompt history diverged from what was captured, that the request's
      `system` field was present but is not shown, or that
      prompt-carried history was suppressed because the session spans the
      child organization's retention boundary and those turns cannot be
      placed against it (the marker's text names the cause). Markers that
      report a mismatch with captured history can result from normal request
      or client processing, not only client modification.

      - `type: "synthetic_marker"`

        - `"synthetic_marker"`

  - `role: "assistant" or "user"`

    Message sender (`user` or `assistant`)

    - `"assistant"`

    - `"user"`

  - `type: "compliance_local_session_message"`

    - `"compliance_local_session_message"`

- `next_page: string or null`

  Opaque pagination cursor (prefixed `page_`) for the next page. Null when there is no further page. Treat as an opaque string; the format may change without notice.

- `session: object { id, created_at, organization_uuid, 4 more }`

  The local session the messages belong to. `user.email_address` is always null on this endpoint; the messages endpoint does not resolve email addresses.

  - `id: string`

    Local session identifier, prefixed `clls_`. Unique within the parent organization. Treat as an opaque string; the format may change without notice.

  - `created_at: string`

    Timestamp of the session's first retained inference call (RFC 3339, UTC). When a session's activity spans the child organization's retention boundary, calls older than the boundary are no longer reflected, so this value is the timestamp of the earliest retained call: always strictly after the boundary, never the boundary itself.

  - `organization_uuid: string`

    UUID of the child organization the session belongs to

  - `product_surface: string or null`

    The product the session ran in: `cowork` for Cowork sessions in Claude Desktop, or `claude_code` for Claude Code sessions. New values appear as coverage expands; treat unrecognized values as opaque. `null` when the surface was not recorded.

  - `type: "compliance_local_session"`

    - `"compliance_local_session"`

  - `user: object { id, email_address }`

    The authenticated user at the time of the session. Always set; `user.id` is always populated. `user.email_address` is null when the user's account has been deleted or the user is no longer a member of an organization the key may read.

    - `id: string`

      User identifier (tagged ID, prefixed `user_`). Always set, so attribution survives after the user's account is deleted or the user leaves the organizations the key may read.

    - `email_address: string or null`

      User's email address. Null when the user's account has been deleted or the user is no longer a member of an organization the key may read. The messages endpoint does not resolve email addresses; this field is always null there.

  - `workspace_id: string or null`

    Workspace identifier (tagged ID, prefixed `wrkspc_`). Null for sessions not attributed to a workspace.

- `MessageListResponse object { id, content, created_at, 3 more }`

  A single user or assistant turn in a local session transcript.

  - `id: string`

    Message identifier, prefixed `clsm_`.
