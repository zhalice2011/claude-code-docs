## Get project document metadata

**get** `/v1/compliance/apps/projects/documents/{document_id}/metadata`

Returns metadata for a project document, without the content body.

Use the sibling `GET /v1/compliance/apps/projects/documents/{document_id}`
endpoint to fetch the document text. The `md5` and `size_bytes`
fields here are computed over the UTF-8 encoding of that text, so a DLP
consumer can dedupe or match hashes without downloading every document.

### Path Parameters

- `document_id: string`

  The document ID (tagged ID, e.g., claude_proj_doc_abc123)

### Header Parameters

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

### Returns

- `id: string`

  Project document identifier (tagged ID)

- `claude_project_id: string`

  The project this document belongs to

- `created_at: string`

  Document creation timestamp

- `filename: string`

  Document filename

- `md5: string`

  Lowercase hex MD5 of the document content (UTF-8 encoded). Matches the `content` field returned by the sibling content endpoint.

- `mime_type: "text/plain"`

  MIME type of the document content, always plain text

  - `"text/plain"`

- `size_bytes: number`

  Size in bytes of the document content (UTF-8 encoded)

- `user: object { id, email_address }`

  The user who created a project or project document.

  Fields that reference this type are null when the creator's account has
  been deleted or the creator is no longer a member of any organization
  under the parent organization.

  - `id: string`

    User identifier (tagged ID)

  - `email_address: string`

    User's email address

### Example
