# Handle approvals and user input

Surface Claude's approval requests and clarifying questions to users, then return their decisions to the SDK.

---

While working on a task, Claude sometimes needs to check in with users. It might need permission before deleting files, or need to ask which database to use for a new project. Your application needs to surface these requests to users so Claude can continue with their input.

Claude requests user input in two situations: when it needs **permission to use a tool** (like deleting files or running commands), and when it has **clarifying questions** (via the `AskUserQuestion` tool). Both trigger your `canUseTool` callback, which pauses execution until you return a response. This is different from normal conversation turns where Claude finishes and waits for your next message.

For clarifying questions, Claude generates the questions and options. Your role is to present them to users and return their selections. You can't add your own questions to this flow; if you need to ask users something yourself, do that separately in your application logic.

This guide shows you how to detect each type of request and respond appropriately.

## Detect when Claude needs input

Pass a `canUseTool` callback in your query options. The callback fires whenever Claude needs user input, receiving the tool name and input as arguments:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
async def handle_tool_request(tool_name, input_data, context):
    # Prompt user and return allow or deny
    ...

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(can_use_tool=handle_tool_request)
```

```typescript TypeScript
async function handleToolRequest(toolName, input) {
  // Prompt user and return allow or deny
}

const options = { canUseTool: handleToolRequest }
```
</CodeGroup>

The callback fires in two cases:

1. **Tool needs approval**: Claude wants to use a tool that isn't auto-approved by [permission rules](/docs/en/agent-sdk/permissions) or modes. Check `tool_name` for the tool (e.g., `"Bash"`, `"Write"`).
2. **Claude asks a question**: Claude calls the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Check if `tool_name == "AskUserQuestion"` to handle it differently. If you specify a `tools` array, include `AskUserQuestion` for this to work. See [Handle clarifying questions](#handle-clarifying-questions) for details.

Your callback must return within **60 seconds** or Claude will assume the request was denied and try a different approach.

<Note>
To automatically allow or deny tools without prompting users, use [hooks](/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks) instead. Hooks execute before `canUseTool` and can allow, deny, or modify requests based on your own logic. You can also use the [`PermissionRequest` hook](/docs/en/agent-sdk/hooks#available-hooks) to send external notifications (Slack, email, push) when Claude is waiting for approval.
</Note>

## Handle tool approval requests

Once you've passed a `canUseTool` callback in your query options, it fires when Claude wants to use a tool that isn't auto-approved. Your callback receives two arguments:

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `toolName` | The name of the tool Claude wants to use (e.g., `"Bash"`, `"Write"`, `"Edit"`) |
| `input` | The parameters Claude is passing to the tool. Contents vary by tool. |

The `input` object contains tool-specific parameters. Common examples:

| Tool | Input fields |
|------|--------------|
| `Bash` | `command`, `description`, `timeout` |
| `Write` | `file_path`, `content` |
| `Edit` | `file_path`, `old_string`, `new_string` |
| `Read` | `file_path`, `offset`, `limit` |

See the SDK reference for complete input schemas: [Python](/docs/en/agent-sdk/python#tool-inputoutput-types) | [TypeScript](/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript#tool-input-types).

You can display this information to the user so they can decide whether to allow or reject the action, then return the appropriate response.

The following example asks Claude to create and delete a test file. When Claude attempts each operation, the callback prints the tool request to the terminal and prompts for y/n approval.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import asyncio

from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions, query
from claude_agent_sdk.types import (
    HookMatcher,
    PermissionResultAllow,
    PermissionResultDeny,
    ToolPermissionContext,
)


async def can_use_tool(
    tool_name: str, input_data: dict, context: ToolPermissionContext
) -> PermissionResultAllow | PermissionResultDeny:
    # Display the tool request
    print(f"\nTool: {tool_name}")
    if tool_name == "Bash":
        print(f"Command: {input_data.get('command')}")
        if input_data.get("description"):
            print(f"Description: {input_data.get('description')}")
    else:
        print(f"Input: {input_data}")

    # Get user approval
    response = input("Allow this action? (y/n): ")

    # Return allow or deny based on user's response
    if response.lower() == "y":
        # Allow: tool executes with the original (or modified) input
        return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data)
    else:
        # Deny: tool doesn't execute, Claude sees the message
        return PermissionResultDeny(message="User denied this action")


# Required workaround: dummy hook keeps the stream open for can_use_tool
async def dummy_hook(input_data, tool_use_id, context):
    return {"continue_": True}


async def prompt_stream():
    yield {
        "type": "user",
        "message": {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Create a test file in /tmp and then delete it",
        },
    }


async def main():
    async for message in query(
        prompt=prompt_stream(),
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            can_use_tool=can_use_tool,
            hooks={"PreToolUse": [HookMatcher(matcher=None, hooks=[dummy_hook])]},
        ),
    ):
        if hasattr(message, "result"):
            print(message.result)


asyncio.run(main())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";
import * as readline from "readline";

// Helper to prompt user for input in the terminal
function prompt(question: string): Promise<string> {
  const rl = readline.createInterface({
    input: process.stdin,
    output: process.stdout,
  });
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    rl.question(question, (answer) => {
      rl.close();
      resolve(answer);
    })
  );
}

for await (const message of query({
  prompt: "Create a test file in /tmp and then delete it",
  options: {
    canUseTool: async (toolName, input) => {
      // Display the tool request
      console.log(`\nTool: ${toolName}`);
      if (toolName === "Bash") {
        console.log(`Command: ${input.command}`);
        if (input.description) console.log(`Description: ${input.description}`);
      } else {
        console.log(`Input: ${JSON.stringify(input, null, 2)}`);
      }

      // Get user approval
      const response = await prompt("Allow this action? (y/n): ");

      // Return allow or deny based on user's response
      if (response.toLowerCase() === "y") {
        // Allow: tool executes with the original (or modified) input
        return { behavior: "allow", updatedInput: input };
      } else {
        // Deny: tool doesn't execute, Claude sees the message
        return { behavior: "deny", message: "User denied this action" };
      }
    },
  },
})) {
  if ("result" in message) console.log(message.result);
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
In Python, `can_use_tool` requires [streaming mode](/docs/en/agent-sdk/streaming-vs-single-mode) and a `PreToolUse` hook that returns `{"continue_": True}` to keep the stream open. Without this hook, the stream closes before the permission callback can be invoked.
</Note>

This example uses a `y/n` flow where any input other than `y` is treated as a denial. In practice, you might build a richer UI that lets users modify the request, provide feedback, or redirect Claude entirely. See [Respond to tool requests](#respond-to-tool-requests) for all the ways you can respond.

### Respond to tool requests

Your callback returns one of two response types:

| Response | Python | TypeScript |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Allow** | `PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=...)` | `{ behavior: "allow", updatedInput }` |
| **Deny** | `PermissionResultDeny(message=...)` | `{ behavior: "deny", message }` |

When allowing, pass the tool input (original or modified). When denying, provide a message explaining why. Claude sees this message and may adjust its approach.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from claude_agent_sdk.types import PermissionResultAllow, PermissionResultDeny

# Allow the tool to execute
return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data)

# Block the tool
return PermissionResultDeny(message="User rejected this action")
```

```typescript TypeScript
// Allow the tool to execute
return { behavior: "allow", updatedInput: input };

// Block the tool
return { behavior: "deny", message: "User rejected this action" };
```

</CodeGroup>

Beyond allowing or denying, you can modify the tool's input or provide context that helps Claude adjust its approach:

- **Approve**: let the tool execute as Claude requested
- **Approve with changes**: modify the input before execution (e.g., sanitize paths, add constraints)
- **Reject**: block the tool and tell Claude why
- **Suggest alternative**: block but guide Claude toward what the user wants instead
- **Redirect entirely**: use [streaming input](/docs/en/agent-sdk/streaming-vs-single-mode) to send Claude a completely new instruction

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Approve">
    The user approves the action as-is. Pass through the `input` from your callback unchanged and the tool executes exactly as Claude requested.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    async def can_use_tool(tool_name, input_data, context):
        print(f"Claude wants to use {tool_name}")
        approved = await ask_user("Allow this action?")

        if approved:
            return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data)
        return PermissionResultDeny(message="User declined")
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    canUseTool: async (toolName, input) => {
      console.log(`Claude wants to use ${toolName}`);
      const approved = await askUser("Allow this action?");

      if (approved) {
        return { behavior: "allow", updatedInput: input };
      }
      return { behavior: "deny", message: "User declined" };
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Approve with changes">
    The user approves but wants to modify the request first. You can change the input before the tool executes. Claude sees the result but isn't told you changed anything. Useful for sanitizing parameters, adding constraints, or scoping access.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    async def can_use_tool(tool_name, input_data, context):
        if tool_name == "Bash":
            # User approved, but scope all commands to sandbox
            sandboxed_input = {**input_data}
            sandboxed_input["command"] = input_data["command"].replace("/tmp", "/tmp/sandbox")
            return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=sandboxed_input)
        return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    canUseTool: async (toolName, input) => {
      if (toolName === "Bash") {
        // User approved, but scope all commands to sandbox
        const sandboxedInput = {
          ...input,
          command: input.command.replace("/tmp", "/tmp/sandbox")
        };
        return { behavior: "allow", updatedInput: sandboxedInput };
      }
      return { behavior: "allow", updatedInput: input };
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Reject">
    The user doesn't want this action to happen. Block the tool and provide a message explaining why. Claude sees this message and may try a different approach.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    async def can_use_tool(tool_name, input_data, context):
        approved = await ask_user(f"Allow {tool_name}?")

        if not approved:
            return PermissionResultDeny(message="User rejected this action")
        return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    canUseTool: async (toolName, input) => {
      const approved = await askUser(`Allow ${toolName}?`);

      if (!approved) {
        return {
          behavior: "deny",
          message: "User rejected this action"
        };

    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Suggest alternative">
    The user doesn't want this specific action, but has a different idea. Block the tool and include guidance in your message. Claude will read this and decide how to proceed based on your feedback.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    async def can_use_tool(tool_name, input_data, context):
        if tool_name == "Bash" and "rm" in input_data.get("command", ""):
            # User doesn't want to delete, suggest archiving instead
            return PermissionResultDeny(
                message="User doesn't want to delete files. They asked if you could compress them into an archive instead."
            )
        return PermissionResultAllow(updated_input=input_data)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript

  <Tab title="Redirect entirely">
    For a complete change of direction (not just a nudge), use [streaming input](/docs/en/agent-sdk/streaming-vs-single-mode) to send Claude a new instruction directly. This bypasses the current tool request and gives Claude entirely new instructions to follow.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Handle clarifying questions

When Claude needs more direction on a task with multiple valid approaches, it calls the `AskUserQuestion` tool. This triggers your `canUseTool` callback with `toolName` set to `AskUserQuestion`. The input contains Claude's questions as multiple-choice options, which you display to the user and return their selections.

The following steps show how to handle clarifying questions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pass a canUseTool callback">
    Pass a `canUseTool` callback in your query options. By default, `AskUserQuestion` is available. If you specify a `tools` array to restrict Claude's capabilities (for example, a read-only agent with only `Read`, `Glob`, and `Grep`), include `AskUserQuestion` in that array. Otherwise, Claude won't be able to ask clarifying questions:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    async for message in query(
        prompt="Analyze this codebase",
        options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
            # Include AskUserQuestion in your tools list
            tools=["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "AskUserQuestion"],
            can_use_tool=can_use_tool,
        ),
    ):
        # ...
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    for await (const message of query({
      prompt: "Analyze this codebase",
      options: {
        // Include AskUserQuestion in your tools list
        tools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep", "AskUserQuestion"],
        canUseTool: async (toolName, input) => {
          // Handle clarifying questions here
        },
      },
    })) {
      // ...
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect AskUserQuestion">
    In your callback, check if `toolName` equals `AskUserQuestion` to handle it differently from other tools:

    <CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    async def can_use_tool(tool_name: str, input_data: dict, context):
        if tool_name == "AskUserQuestion":
            # Your implementation to collect answers from the user
            return await handle_clarifying_questions(input_data)
        # Handle other tools normally
        return await prompt_for_approval(tool_name, input_data)
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    canUseTool: async (toolName, input) => {
      if (toolName === "AskUserQuestion") {
        // Your implementation to collect answers from the user
        return handleClarifyingQuestions(input);
      }
      // Handle other tools normally
      return promptForApproval(toolName, input);
    }
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Parse the question input">
    The input contains Claude's questions in a `questions` array. Each question has a `question` (the text to display), `options` (the choices), and `multiSelect` (whether multiple selections are allowed):

    ```json
    {
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "How should I format the output?",
          "header": "Format",
          "options": [
            { "label": "Summary", "description": "Brief overview" },
            { "label": "Detailed", "description": "Full explanation" }
          ],
          "multiSelect": false
        },
        {
          "question": "Which sections should I include?",
          "header": "Sections",
          "options": [
            { "label": "Introduction", "description": "Opening context" },
            { "label": "Conclusion", "description": "Final summary" }
          ],
          "multiSelect": true
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    See [Question format](#question-format) for full field descriptions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Collect answers from the user">
    Present the questions to the user and collect their selections. How you do this depends on your application: a terminal prompt, a web form, a mobile dialog, etc.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Return answers to Claude">
    Build the `answers` object as a record where each key is the `question` text and each value is the selected option's `label`:

    | From the question object | Use as |
    |--------------------------|--------|
    | `question` field (e.g., `"How should I format the output?"`) | Key |
    | Selected option's `label` field (e.g., `"Summary"`) | Value |

    For multi-select questions, join multiple labels with `", "`. If you [support free-text input](#support-free-text-input), use the user's custom text as the value.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```python Python
    return PermissionResultAllow(
        updated_input={
            "questions": input_data.get("questions", []),
            "answers": {
                "How should I format the output?": "Summary",
                "Which sections should I include?": "Introduction, Conclusion"
            }
        }
    )
    ```

    ```typescript TypeScript
    return {
      behavior: "allow",
      updatedInput: {
        questions: input.questions,
        answers: {
          "How should I format the output?": "Summary",
          "Which sections should I include?": "Introduction, Conclusion"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Question format

The input contains Claude's generated questions in a `questions` array. Each question has these fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `question` | The full question text to display |
| `header` | Short label for the question (max 12 characters) |
| `options` | Array of 2-4 choices, each with `label` and `description` |
| `multiSelect` | If `true`, users can select multiple options |

Here's an example of the structure you'll receive:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "How should I format the output?",
      "header": "Format",
      "options": [
        { "label": "Summary", "description": "Brief overview of key points" },
        { "label": "Detailed", "description": "Full explanation with examples" }
      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response format

Return an `answers` object mapping each question's `question` field to the selected option's `label`:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `questions` | Pass through the original questions array (required for tool processing) |
| `answers` | Object where keys are question text and values are selected labels |

For multi-select questions, join multiple labels with `", "`. For free-text input, use the user's custom text directly.

```json
{
  "questions": [...],
  "answers": {
    "How should I format the output?": "Summary",
    "Which sections should I include?": "Introduction, Conclusion"
  }
}
```

#### Support free-text input

Claude's predefined options won't always cover what users want. To let users type their own answer:

- Display an additional "Other" choice after Claude's options that accepts text input
- Use the user's custom text as the answer value (not the word "Other")

See the [complete example](#complete-example) below for a full implementation.

### Complete example

Claude asks clarifying questions when it needs user input to proceed. For example, when asked to help decide on a tech stack for a mobile app, Claude might ask about cross-platform vs native, backend preferences, or target platforms. These questions help Claude make decisions that match the user's preferences rather than guessing.

This example handles those questions in a terminal application. Here's what happens at each step:

1. **Route the request**: The `canUseTool` callback checks if the tool name is `"AskUserQuestion"` and routes to a dedicated handler
2. **Display questions**: The handler loops through the `questions` array and prints each question with numbered options
3. **Collect input**: The user can enter a number to select an option, or type free text directly (e.g., "jquery", "i don't know")
4. **Map answers**: The code checks if input is numeric (uses the option's label) or free text (uses the text directly)
5. **Return to Claude**: The response includes both the original `questions` array and the `answers` mapping

## Limitations

- **60-second timeout**: `canUseTool` callbacks must return within 60 seconds or Claude will retry with a different approach
- **Subagents**: `AskUserQuestion` is not currently available in subagents spawned via the Task tool
- **Question limits**: each `AskUserQuestion` call supports 1-4 questions with 2-4 options each

## Other ways to get user input

The `canUseTool` callback and `AskUserQuestion` tool cover most approval and clarification scenarios, but the SDK offers other ways to get input from users:

### Streaming input

Use [streaming input](/docs/en/agent-sdk/streaming-vs-single-mode) when you need to:

- **Interrupt the agent mid-task**: send a cancel signal or change direction while Claude is working
- **Provide additional context**: add information Claude needs without waiting for it to ask
- **Build chat interfaces**: let users send follow-up messages during long-running operations

Streaming input is ideal for conversational UIs where users interact with the agent throughout execution, not just at approval checkpoints.

### Custom tools

Use [custom tools](/docs/en/agent-sdk/custom-tools) when you need to:

- **Collect structured input**: build forms, wizards, or multi-step workflows that go beyond `AskUserQuestion`'s multiple-choice format
- **Integrate external approval systems**: connect to existing ticketing, workflow, or approval platforms
- **Implement domain-specific interactions**: create tools tailored to your application's needs, like code review interfaces or deployment checklists

Custom tools give you full control over the interaction, but require more implementation work than using the built-in `canUseTool` callback.
