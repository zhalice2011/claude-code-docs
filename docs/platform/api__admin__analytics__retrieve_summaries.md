## Get Activity Summaries

**get** `/v1/organizations/analytics/summaries`

Get organization-wide activity summaries for a date range.

Returns one entry per day in [starting_date, ending_date). Data is
typically available with a 1-day lag and may be revised by a few percent
over the following days: when ending_date is omitted it defaults to the
most recent available day + 1, so the last entry covers the most recent
available day. Available to organizations on a Claude Enterprise plan.
Requires an API key with the `read:analytics` scope.

### Query Parameters

- `starting_date: string`

  UTC date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Start of the date range (inclusive). Data is typically available with a 1-day lag (varies by query; the error for a too-recent date names the latest available day) and may be revised by a few percent over the following days. No earlier than 2026-01-01.

- `ending_date: optional string`

  UTC date in YYYY-MM-DD format. End of the date range (exclusive). Data is typically available with a 1-day lag, so this can be at most today — which is also the default when omitted, making the last entry cover the most recent available day. Data may be revised by a few percent over the following days. The range may span at most 366 days.

- `filter: optional array of string`

  Filters as 'dimension:value'. Only rbac_group_id is supported (e.g. filter[]=rbac_group_id:<id>); repeat the param to OR across groups. Scopes the whole day series to members of the matching group(s), re-aggregated from member-level activity — org-wide seat/invite fields and the adoption rates derived from them are null on scoped rows. rbac_group_id accepts the tagged id (rbac_group_..., as emitted in responses and by the spend-limits API) or a bare group UUID, and matches users who held the group at any point during each UTC day (time-of-usage attribution). At most 100 entries.

### Returns

- `ActivitySummary object { summaries }`

  Response for GET /v1/organizations/analytics/summaries.
