## List Tunnels

**get** `/v1/organizations/tunnels`

**Deprecated.** This Admin API endpoint is superseded by `/v1/tunnels` on the Claude API and will be removed after a migration window. New integrations should use [`/v1/tunnels`](/docs/en/api/beta/tunnels) with the `anthropic-beta: mcp-tunnels-2026-06-22` header and a WIF token carrying the `workspace:manage_tunnels` scope. Existing integrations continue to work with the `mcp-tunnels-2026-05-19` header and `org:manage_tunnels` scope during the migration window.

List the organization's tunnels.

Results span the caller's organization, ordered by creation time
(newest first). Use `workspace_id` to filter to a single workspace;
archived tunnels are excluded unless `include_archived` is set.

### Query Parameters

- `include_archived: optional boolean`

  Include archived tunnels in the results. Archived tunnels are excluded by
  default.

- `limit: optional number`

  Maximum number of tunnels to return in a single page.

- `page: optional string`

  Opaque pagination cursor from a previous response's `next_page`. Omit to
  fetch the first page.

- `workspace_id: optional string`

  Return only tunnels in this Workspace. Accepts a `wrkspc_`-prefixed
  Workspace ID; omit to list tunnels across all Workspaces.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": array of "mcp-tunnels-2026-05-19"`

  Required for all Tunnel endpoints.

  - `"mcp-tunnels-2026-05-19"`

### Returns

- `data: array of object { id, archived_at, created_at, 4 more }`

  - `id: string`

    ID of the Tunnel.

  - `archived_at: string`

    RFC 3339 datetime string indicating when the Tunnel was archived, or
    `null` if it is not archived.

  - `created_at: string`

    RFC 3339 datetime string indicating when the Tunnel was created.

  - `display_name: string`

    Human-readable name for the Tunnel (1–255 characters), or `null` if unset.

  - `domain: string`

    Anthropic-assigned hostname for the Tunnel. MCP server URLs whose host is a
    subdomain of this value are routed through the Tunnel. Globally unique and
    never reused, even after the Tunnel is archived.

  - `type: "tunnel"`

    Object type. Always `tunnel` for Tunnels.

    - `"tunnel"`

  - `workspace_id: string`

    ID of the Workspace this Tunnel belongs to, or `null` for the default
    Workspace. Immutable after creation.

- `next_page: string`

  Opaque cursor for the next page, or `null` if there are no more results.
