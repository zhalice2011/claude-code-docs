## Update Service Account

**post** `/v1/organizations/service_accounts/{service_account_id}`

Update a service account.

Only `description` and `organization_role` are mutable; `name` cannot be
changed. Archived service accounts cannot be updated; this returns 400.
Setting `organization_role` to `admin` (even when unchanged) requires an
interactive credential (a user OAuth token or a Console session). Admin
API keys are not accepted.

### Path Parameters

- `service_account_id: string`

  ID of the service account to update.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Body Parameters

- `description: optional string`

  Replaces the description. Omit to leave unchanged; send `null` to clear (the field is stored as an empty string).

- `organization_role: optional "admin" or "developer"`

  Replaces the org-level role. Omit or send `null` to leave unchanged.

  - `"admin"`

  - `"developer"`

### Returns

- `ServiceAccount object { id, archived_at, archived_by_actor_id, 8 more }`

  Named non-human identity within the caller's organization.

  A service account is a pure identity: name + org. Authorization lives on
  whatever references it (federation rules).

  - `id: string`

    Tagged ID of the service account.

  - `archived_at: string`

    If set, this service account is archived.

  - `archived_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that archived this service account.

  - `created_at: string`

    When this service account was created.

  - `created_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that created this service account.

  - `description: string`

    Optional free-text description.

  - `name: string`

    Admin-chosen slug identifier.

  - `organization_role: "admin" or "developer"`

    Org-level role. A federation rule may only be created or retargeted to grant `org:admin` scope when this is `admin`. A rule granting `org:admin` whose target is later demoted to `developer` is rejected at token exchange. Rules granting `org:admin` are managed in the Console.

    - `"admin"`

    - `"developer"`

  - `type: "service_account"`

    - `"service_account"`

  - `updated_at: string`

    When this service account was last updated.

  - `updated_by_actor_id: string`

    Tagged ID (`user_`/`svac_`) of the actor that last updated this service account.
