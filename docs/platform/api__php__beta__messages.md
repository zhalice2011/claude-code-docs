# Messages

## Create a Message

`$client->beta->messages->create(int maxTokens, list<BetaMessageParam> messages, Model model, ?BetaCacheControlEphemeral cacheControl, ?Container container, ?BetaContextManagementConfig contextManagement, ?BetaDiagnosticsParam diagnostics, ?string fallbackCreditToken, ?list<BetaFallbackParam> fallbacks, ?string inferenceGeo, ?list<BetaRequestMCPServerURLDefinition> mcpServers, ?BetaMetadata metadata, ?BetaOutputConfig outputConfig, ?BetaJSONOutputFormat outputFormat, ?ServiceTier serviceTier, ?Speed speed, ?list<string> stopSequences, ?System system, ?float temperature, ?BetaThinkingConfigParam thinking, ?BetaToolChoice toolChoice, ?list<BetaToolUnion> tools, ?int topK, ?float topP, ?list<AnthropicBeta> betas, ?string userProfileID): BetaMessage`

**post** `/v1/messages`

Send a structured list of input messages with text and/or image content, and the model will generate the next message in the conversation.

The Messages API can be used for either single queries or stateless multi-turn conversations.

Learn more about the Messages API in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/get-started)

### Parameters

- `maxTokens: int`

  The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

  Note that our models may stop _before_ reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.

  Set to `0` to populate the [prompt cache](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching#pre-warming-the-cache) without generating a response.

  Different models have different maximum values for this parameter.  See [models](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) for details.

- `messages: list<BetaMessageParam>`

  Input messages.

  Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

  Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

  If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

  Example with a single `user` message:

  ```json
  [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
  ```

  Example with multiple conversational turns:

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
  ]
  ```

  Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
  ]
  ```

  Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

  ```json
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
  ```

  ```json
  {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
  ```

  See [input examples](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages).

  Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

  There is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request.

- `model: Model`

  The model that will complete your prompt.

  See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional details and options.

- `cacheControl?:optional BetaCacheControlEphemeral`

  Top-level cache control automatically applies a cache_control marker to the last cacheable block in the request.

- `container?:optional Container`

  Container identifier for reuse across requests.

- `contextManagement?:optional BetaContextManagementConfig`

  Context management configuration.

  This allows you to control how Claude manages context across multiple requests, such as whether to clear function results or not.

- `diagnostics?:optional BetaDiagnosticsParam`

  Request-level diagnostics. Currently carries the previous response
  id for prompt-cache divergence reporting.

- `fallbackCreditToken?:optional string`

  The `fallback_credit_token` from a prior refusal's `stop_details`.

  When a preceding request was refused and returned a `fallback_credit_token`,
  pass that code here on the retry to have the retry's cache-creation tokens
  for the prefix that was warm on the refused model billed at the cache-read
  rate. Must be redeemed by the same organization and workspace, with the same
  request body (optionally extended by one appended `assistant` message whose
  content is the partial text — with any trailing whitespace stripped from
  the final text block — and paired server-tool blocks streamed before the
  refusal; the appended-assistant form is not available for requests with
  `output_format` set or forced `tool_choice`), on an eligible fallback
  model, on the same platform,
  and within 5 minutes of the refusal; a mismatch is a 400. A token minted
  mid-server-tool-loop whose partial content was continuable may only be
  redeemed with the appended-assistant form — if an exact-body retry is
  rejected with a 400 saying the token must be redeemed by continuing the
  partial response, retry with the appended-assistant form instead.

  When the appended-assistant form is used on a model that otherwise disallows
  assistant-turn prefill, this token also authorizes that one prefill.

- `fallbacks?:optional list<BetaFallbackParam>`

  Opt-in server-side retry on one or more substitute models when the requested model declines for policy reasons. Tried in order: if the first entry also declines, the second is tried, and so on.

- `inferenceGeo?:optional string`

  Specifies the geographic region for inference processing. If not specified, the workspace's `default_inference_geo` is used.

- `mcpServers?:optional list<BetaRequestMCPServerURLDefinition>`

  MCP servers to be utilized in this request

- `metadata?:optional BetaMetadata`

  An object describing metadata about the request.

- `outputConfig?:optional BetaOutputConfig`

  Configuration options for the model's output, such as the output format.

- `outputFormat?:optional BetaJSONOutputFormat`

  Deprecated: Use `output_config.format` instead. See [structured outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs)

  A schema to specify Claude's output format in responses. This parameter will be removed in a future release.

- `serviceTier?:optional ServiceTier`

  Determines whether to use priority capacity (if available) or standard capacity for this request.

  Anthropic offers different levels of service for your API requests. See [service-tiers](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/service-tiers) for details.

- `speed?:optional Speed`

  The inference speed mode for this request. `"fast"` enables high output-tokens-per-second inference.

- `stopSequences?:optional list<string>`

  Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.

  Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn, which will result in a response `stop_reason` of `"end_turn"`.

  If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of text, you can use the `stop_sequences` parameter. If the model encounters one of the custom sequences, the response `stop_reason` value will be `"stop_sequence"` and the response `stop_sequence` value will contain the matched stop sequence.

- `stream?:optional bool`

  Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.

  See [streaming](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming) for details.

- `system?:optional System`

  System prompt.

  A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such as specifying a particular goal or role. See our [guide to system prompts](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role).

- `temperature?:optional float`

  Amount of randomness injected into the response.

  Defaults to `1.0`. Ranges from `0.0` to `1.0`. Use `temperature` closer to `0.0` for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to `1.0` for creative and generative tasks.

  Note that even with `temperature` of `0.0`, the results will not be fully deterministic.

- `thinking?:optional BetaThinkingConfigParam`

  Configuration for enabling Claude's extended thinking.

  When enabled, responses include `thinking` content blocks showing Claude's thinking process before the final answer. Requires a minimum budget of 1,024 tokens and counts towards your `max_tokens` limit.

  See [extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for details.

- `toolChoice?:optional BetaToolChoice`

  How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool, any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

- `tools?:optional list<BetaToolUnion>`

  Definitions of tools that the model may use.

  If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

  There are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).

  Each tool definition includes:

  * `name`: Name of the tool.
  * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
  * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

  For example, if you defined `tools` as:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "ticker": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
          }
        },
        "required": ["ticker"]
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

  And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
    }
  ]
  ```

  You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
      "content": "259.75 USD"
    }
  ]
  ```

  Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

  See our [guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) for more details.

- `topK?:optional int`

  Only sample from the top K options for each subsequent token.

  Used to remove "long tail" low probability responses. [Learn more technical details here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-sample-from-language-models-682bceb97277).

  Recommended for advanced use cases only.

- `topP?:optional float`

  Use nucleus sampling.

  In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by `top_p`.

  Recommended for advanced use cases only.

- `betas?:optional list<AnthropicBeta>`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

- `userProfileID?:optional string`

  The user profile ID to attribute this request to. Use when acting on behalf of a party other than your organization. Requires the `user-profiles` beta header.

### Returns

- `BetaMessage`

  - `string id`

    Unique object identifier.

    The format and length of IDs may change over time.

  - `?BetaContainer container`

    Information about the container used in the request (for the code execution tool)

  - `list<BetaContentBlock> content`

    Content generated by the model.

    This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

    Example:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
    ```

    If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

    For example, if the input `messages` were:

    ```json
    [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
    ]
    ```

    Then the response `content` might be:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
    ```

  - `?BetaContextManagementResponse contextManagement`

    Context management response.

    Information about context management strategies applied during the request.

  - `?BetaDiagnostics diagnostics`

    Response envelope for request-level diagnostics. Present (possibly
    null) whenever the caller supplied `diagnostics` on the request.

  - `Model model`

    The model that will complete your prompt.

    See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional details and options.

  - `"assistant" role`

    Conversational role of the generated message.

    This will always be `"assistant"`.

  - `?BetaRefusalStopDetails stopDetails`

    Structured information about a refusal.

  - `?BetaStopReason stopReason`

    The reason that we stopped.

    This may be one the following values:

    * `"end_turn"`: the model reached a natural stopping point
    * `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded the requested `max_tokens` or the model's maximum
    * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
    * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools
    * `"pause_turn"`: we paused a long-running turn. You may provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let the model continue.
    * `"refusal"`: when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations

    In non-streaming mode this value is always non-null. In streaming mode, it is null in the `message_start` event and non-null otherwise.

  - `?string stopSequence`

    Which custom stop sequence was generated, if any.

    This value will be a non-null string if one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

  - `"message" type`

    Object type.

    For Messages, this is always `"message"`.

  - `BetaUsage usage`

    Billing and rate-limit usage.

    Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

    Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

    For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

    Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

## Count tokens in a Message

`$client->beta->messages->countTokens(list<BetaMessageParam> messages, Model model, ?BetaCacheControlEphemeral cacheControl, ?BetaContextManagementConfig contextManagement, ?list<BetaRequestMCPServerURLDefinition> mcpServers, ?BetaOutputConfig outputConfig, ?BetaJSONOutputFormat outputFormat, ?Speed speed, ?System system, ?BetaThinkingConfigParam thinking, ?BetaToolChoice toolChoice, ?list<Tool> tools, ?list<AnthropicBeta> betas, ?string userProfileID): BetaMessageTokensCount`

**post** `/v1/messages/count_tokens`

Count the number of tokens in a Message.

The Token Count API can be used to count the number of tokens in a Message, including tools, images, and documents, without creating it.

Learn more about token counting in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/token-counting)

### Parameters

- `messages: list<BetaMessageParam>`

  Input messages.

  Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.

  Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.

  If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.

  Example with a single `user` message:

  ```json
  [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
  ```

  Example with multiple conversational turns:

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
  ]
  ```

  Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

  ```json
  [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
  ]
  ```

  Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:

  ```json
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
  ```

  ```json
  {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
  ```

  See [input examples](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/working-with-messages).

  Note that if you want to include a [system prompt](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role), you can use the top-level `system` parameter — there is no `"system"` role for input messages in the Messages API.

  There is a limit of 100,000 messages in a single request.

- `model: Model`

  The model that will complete your prompt.

  See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional details and options.

- `cacheControl?:optional BetaCacheControlEphemeral`

  Top-level cache control automatically applies a cache_control marker to the last cacheable block in the request.

- `contextManagement?:optional BetaContextManagementConfig`

  Context management configuration.

  This allows you to control how Claude manages context across multiple requests, such as whether to clear function results or not.

- `mcpServers?:optional list<BetaRequestMCPServerURLDefinition>`

  MCP servers to be utilized in this request

- `outputConfig?:optional BetaOutputConfig`

  Configuration options for the model's output, such as the output format.

- `outputFormat?:optional BetaJSONOutputFormat`

  Deprecated: Use `output_config.format` instead. See [structured outputs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs)

  A schema to specify Claude's output format in responses. This parameter will be removed in a future release.

- `speed?:optional Speed`

  The inference speed mode for this request. `"fast"` enables high output-tokens-per-second inference.

- `system?:optional System`

  System prompt.

  A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such as specifying a particular goal or role. See our [guide to system prompts](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/claude-prompting-best-practices#give-claude-a-role).

- `thinking?:optional BetaThinkingConfigParam`

  Configuration for enabling Claude's extended thinking.

  When enabled, responses include `thinking` content blocks showing Claude's thinking process before the final answer. Requires a minimum budget of 1,024 tokens and counts towards your `max_tokens` limit.

  See [extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for details.

- `toolChoice?:optional BetaToolChoice`

  How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool, any available tool, decide by itself, or not use tools at all.

- `tools?:optional list<Tool>`

  Definitions of tools that the model may use.

  If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using `tool_result` content blocks.

  There are two types of tools: **client tools** and **server tools**. The behavior described below applies to client tools. For [server tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools), see their individual documentation as each has its own behavior (e.g., the [web search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool)).

  Each tool definition includes:

  * `name`: Name of the tool.
  * `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
  * `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.

  For example, if you defined `tools` as:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
      "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "ticker": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
          }
        },
        "required": ["ticker"]
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

  And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "tool_use",
      "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
      "name": "get_stock_price",
      "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
    }
  ]
  ```

  You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "type": "tool_result",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
      "content": "259.75 USD"
    }
  ]
  ```

  Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

  See our [guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview) for more details.

- `betas?:optional list<AnthropicBeta>`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

- `userProfileID?:optional string`

  The user profile ID to attribute this request to. Use when acting on behalf of a party other than your organization. Requires the `user-profiles` beta header.

### Returns

- `BetaMessageTokensCount`

  - `?BetaCountTokensContextManagementResponse contextManagement`

    Information about context management applied to the message.

  - `int inputTokens`

    The total number of tokens across the provided list of messages, system prompt, and tools.

### Beta Advisor Result Block

- `BetaAdvisorResultBlock`

  - `?string stopReason`

    The advisor sub-inference's stop reason (same values as the top-level message `stop_reason`). `max_tokens` indicates the advisor's output was truncated at the tool's `max_tokens` value or the advisor model's policy cap.

  - `string text`

  - `"advisor_result" type`

### Beta Advisor Result Block Param

- `BetaAdvisorResultBlockParam`

    The model that will complete your prompt.

    See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional details and options.

  - `"advisor" name`

    Name of the tool.

    This is how the tool will be called by the model and in `tool_use` blocks.

  - `"advisor_20260301" type`

  - `?BetaCacheControlEphemeral cacheControl`

    Create a cache control breakpoint at this content block.

  - `?BetaCacheControlEphemeral caching`

    If true, tool will not be included in initial system prompt. Only loaded when returned via tool_reference from tool search.

  - `?int maxTokens`

    Bounds the advisor's total output (thinking + text) per call. When the advisor hits this cap, the returned advisor_result or advisor_redacted_result block carries stop_reason='max_tokens', and a truncation note is appended to the advice text the worker model sees (inside the encrypted blob in redacted mode). When set, the server also emits a remaining-tokens budget block in the advisor's prompt so the advisor self-shapes toward the cap. When omitted, the advisor model's default output cap applies and no budget block is emitted.

    Unique object identifier.

    The format and length of IDs may change over time.

  - `?BetaContainer container`

    Information about the container used in the request (for the code execution tool)

  - `list<BetaContentBlock> content`

    Content generated by the model.

    This is an array of content blocks, each of which has a `type` that determines its shape.

    Example:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude."}]
    ```

    If the request input `messages` ended with an `assistant` turn, then the response `content` will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.

    For example, if the input `messages` were:

    ```json
    [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("}
    ]
    ```

    Then the response `content` might be:

    ```json
    [{"type": "text", "text": "B)"}]
    ```

  - `?BetaContextManagementResponse contextManagement`

    Context management response.

    Information about context management strategies applied during the request.

  - `?BetaDiagnostics diagnostics`

    Response envelope for request-level diagnostics. Present (possibly
    null) whenever the caller supplied `diagnostics` on the request.

  - `Model model`

    The model that will complete your prompt.

    See [models](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/models-overview) for additional details and options.

  - `"assistant" role`

    Conversational role of the generated message.

    This will always be `"assistant"`.

  - `?BetaRefusalStopDetails stopDetails`

    Structured information about a refusal.

  - `?BetaStopReason stopReason`

    The reason that we stopped.

    This may be one the following values:

    * `"end_turn"`: the model reached a natural stopping point
    * `"max_tokens"`: we exceeded the requested `max_tokens` or the model's maximum
    * `"stop_sequence"`: one of your provided custom `stop_sequences` was generated
    * `"tool_use"`: the model invoked one or more tools
    * `"pause_turn"`: we paused a long-running turn. You may provide the response back as-is in a subsequent request to let the model continue.
    * `"refusal"`: when streaming classifiers intervene to handle potential policy violations

    In non-streaming mode this value is always non-null. In streaming mode, it is null in the `message_start` event and non-null otherwise.

  - `?string stopSequence`

    Which custom stop sequence was generated, if any.

    This value will be a non-null string if one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

  - `"message" type`

    Object type.

    For Messages, this is always `"message"`.

  - `BetaUsage usage`

    Billing and rate-limit usage.

    Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the underlying cost to our systems.

    Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

    For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response from Claude.

    Total input tokens in a request is the summation of `input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`, and `cache_read_input_tokens`.

### Beta Message Delta Usage

    `output_tokens` remains the inclusive, authoritative total used for billing.
    This object provides a read-only decomposition for observability — for example,
    how many of the billed output tokens were spent on internal reasoning that may
    have been summarized before being returned to you.

### Beta Output Tokens Details

- `BetaOutputTokensDetails`

  - `int thinkingTokens`

    Number of output tokens the model generated as internal reasoning, including
    the thinking-block delimiter tokens.

    Reflects the raw reasoning the model produced, not the (possibly shorter)
    summarized thinking text returned in the response body. Computed by
    re-tokenizing the raw reasoning text, so it may differ from the model's exact
    generation count by a small number of tokens. Always ≤ `output_tokens`;
    `output_tokens - thinking_tokens` approximates the non-reasoning output.

      Per-frame increment of a coarse, running estimate of the tokens this thinking block has produced so far. Present whenever the `thinking-token-count-2026-05-13` beta is set; `null` unless `thinking.display` resolves to `"omitted"` and a count is due this frame. Sum the increments across `thinking_delta` frames on this block for a progress indicator. Each increment is a non-negative multiple of a fixed quantum and the cadence is rate-limited, so this is a deliberately lossy display hint, not a billable count; `usage.output_tokens` remains authoritative.

  - `?string explanation`

    Human-readable explanation of the refusal.

    This text is not guaranteed to be stable. `null` when no explanation is available for the category.

  - `?string fallbackCreditToken`

    Opaque code that refunds the cache-miss cost when retrying this refused
    request on the fallback model. Pass it as `fallback_credit_token` on the
    retry request. Expires 5 minutes after the refusal.

    The retry is sent either with the same request body (`system`, `messages`,
    `tools`, and other render-shaping fields), or with the same body plus one
    appended `assistant` message whose content is the partial text (with any
    trailing whitespace stripped from the final text block) and paired
    server-tool blocks from this refusal — which also authorizes that
    appended turn as an assistant-prefill continuation on models that otherwise
    disallow prefill. A token minted mid-server-tool-loop whose partial content
    was continuable may only be redeemed the second way — if a same-body retry
    is rejected with a 400 saying the token must be redeemed by continuing the
    partial response, retry the second way instead. Either way: same workspace,
    same platform; a mismatch is a 400. Resending a token for an already-warm
    prefix is permitted but yields no additional credit.

    `null` when the refused model isn't eligible for a fallback credit.

  - `?bool fallbackHasPrefillClaim`

    Whether the accompanying `fallback_credit_token` may be redeemed with the
    appended-assistant retry form. Only set when `fallback_credit_token` is
    present.

    `true`: retry by resending the same request body plus one appended
    `assistant` message whose content is this response's `content` with any
    trailing whitespace stripped from the final text block and unpaired
    `tool_use` blocks omitted (the same appended-turn shape described on
    `fallback_credit_token`), with the token attached. `false`: retry by
    resending the original request body unchanged, with the token attached —
    the appended-assistant form is not available for this refusal (no
    continuable partial content, or the request uses `output_format` or a
    `tool_choice` that forces tool use). One exception: when the request used
    `output_format` or a forced `tool_choice` and the refusal arrived after
    server tools (including MCP connector tools) had already executed, the
    token may not be redeemable by either retry form; if the exact-body retry
    is then rejected with a 400 saying the token must be redeemed by
    continuing the partial response, discard the token and retry without it.

    Advisory: if an appended-assistant retry is rejected with a 400 despite
    `true`, fall back to resending the original request body with the token.

  - `?string recommendedModel`

    The server's suggested retry target for this refusal. Populated when a fallback attempt could not be made (the fallback model's rate limit was exhausted, or it was overloaded); names the fallback model the caller can retry directly. Null otherwise.

When set, the server also emits a remaining-tokens budget block in the advisor's prompt so the advisor self-shapes toward the cap. When omitted, the advisor model's default output cap applies and no budget block is emitted.

# Batches

## Create a Message Batch

`$client->beta->messages->batches->create(list<Request> requests, ?list<AnthropicBeta> betas, ?string userProfileID): MessageBatch`

**post** `/v1/messages/batches`

Send a batch of Message creation requests.

The Message Batches API can be used to process multiple Messages API requests at once. Once a Message Batch is created, it begins processing immediately. Batches can take up to 24 hours to complete.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

### Parameters

- `requests: list<Request>`

  List of requests for prompt completion. Each is an individual request to create a Message.

- `betas?:optional list<AnthropicBeta>`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

- `userProfileID?:optional string`

  The user profile ID to attribute the requests in this batch to. Use when acting on behalf of a party other than your organization. Requires the `user-profiles` beta header. Applies to every request in the batch; an individual request whose `user_profile_id` body field conflicts with this header is errored.

### Returns

- `MessageBatch`

  - `string id`

    Unique object identifier.

    The format and length of IDs may change over time.

  - `?\Datetime archivedAt`

    RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was archived and its results became unavailable.

  - `?\Datetime cancelInitiatedAt`

    RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which cancellation was initiated for the Message Batch. Specified only if cancellation was initiated.

  - `\Datetime createdAt`

    RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch was created.

  - `?\Datetime endedAt`

    RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which processing for the Message Batch ended. Specified only once processing ends.

    Processing ends when every request in a Message Batch has either succeeded, errored, canceled, or expired.

  - `\Datetime expiresAt`

    RFC 3339 datetime string representing the time at which the Message Batch will expire and end processing, which is 24 hours after creation.

  - `ProcessingStatus processingStatus`

    Processing status of the Message Batch.

  - `MessageBatchRequestCounts requestCounts`

    Tallies requests within the Message Batch, categorized by their status.

    Requests start as `processing` and move to one of the other statuses only once processing of the entire batch ends. The sum of all values always matches the total number of requests in the batch.

  - `?string resultsURL`

    URL to a `.jsonl` file containing the results of the Message Batch requests. Specified only once processing ends.

    Results in the file are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

  - `"message_batch" type`

    Object type.

    For Message Batches, this is always `"message_batch"`.

## Cancel a Message Batch

`$client->beta->messages->batches->cancel(string messageBatchID, ?list<AnthropicBeta> betas): MessageBatch`
