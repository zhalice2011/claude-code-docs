# Prompt caching

Cache prompt prefixes with `cache_control` to cut costs and latency, using automatic caching or explicit breakpoints with 5-minute or 1-hour TTLs.

---

Prompt caching optimizes your API usage by allowing resuming from specific prefixes in your prompts. This significantly reduces processing time and costs for repetitive tasks or prompts with consistent elements.

<Note>
  This feature is eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](/docs/en/build-with-claude/api-and-data-retention). When your organization has a ZDR arrangement, data sent through this feature is not stored after the API response is returned.
</Note>

There are two ways to enable prompt caching:

* **[Automatic caching](#automatic-caching)**: Add a single `cache_control` field at the top level of your request. The system automatically applies the cache breakpoint to the last cacheable block and moves it forward as conversations grow. Best for multi-turn conversations where the growing message history should be cached automatically.
* **[Explicit cache breakpoints](#explicit-cache-breakpoints)**: Place `cache_control` directly on individual content blocks for fine-grained control over exactly what gets cached.

The simplest way to start is with automatic caching:

With automatic caching, the system caches all content up to and including the last cacheable block. On subsequent requests with the same prefix, cached content is reused automatically.

***

## How prompt caching works

When you send a request with prompt caching enabled:

1. The system checks if a prompt prefix, up to a specified cache breakpoint, is already cached from a recent query.
2. If found, it uses the cached version, reducing processing time and costs.
3. Otherwise, it processes the full prompt and caches the prefix once the response begins.

This is especially useful for:

* Prompts with many examples
* Large amounts of context or background information
* Repetitive tasks with consistent instructions
* Long multi-turn conversations

By default, the cache has a 5-minute lifetime. The cache is refreshed for no additional cost each time the cached content is used.

<Note>
  If you find that 5 minutes is too short, Anthropic also offers a 1-hour cache duration [at additional cost](#pricing).

  For more information, see [1-hour cache duration](#1-hour-cache-duration).
</Note>

<Tip>
  **Prompt caching caches the full prefix**

  Prompt caching references the entire prompt - `tools`, `system`, and `messages` (in that order) up to and including the block designated with `cache_control`.
</Tip>

***

## Pricing

Prompt caching introduces a new pricing structure. The following table shows the price per million tokens for each supported model:

<Note>
  The previous table reflects the following pricing multipliers for prompt caching:

  * 5-minute cache write tokens are 1.25 times the base input tokens price
  * 1-hour cache write tokens are 2 times the base input tokens price
  * Cache read tokens are 0.1 times the base input tokens price

  These multipliers stack with other pricing modifiers such as the Batch API discount and data residency. See [pricing](/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) for full details.

***

## Supported models

Prompt caching (both automatic and explicit) is supported on all [active Claude models](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview).

***

## Automatic caching

Automatic caching is the simplest way to enable prompt caching. Instead of placing `cache_control` on individual content blocks, add a single `cache_control` field at the top level of your request body. The system automatically applies the cache breakpoint to the last cacheable block.

### How automatic caching works in multi-turn conversations

With automatic caching, the cache point moves forward automatically as conversations grow. Each new request caches everything up to the last cacheable block, and previous content is read from cache.

The cache breakpoint automatically moves to the last cacheable block in each request, so you don't need to update any `cache_control` markers as the conversation grows.

### TTL support

By default, automatic caching uses a 5-minute TTL. You can specify a 1-hour TTL at 2x the base input token price:

```json
{ "cache_control": { "type": "ephemeral", "ttl": "1h" } }
```

### Combining with block-level caching

Automatic caching is compatible with [explicit cache breakpoints](#explicit-cache-breakpoints). When used together, the automatic cache breakpoint uses one of the 4 available breakpoint slots.

This lets you combine both approaches. For example, use an explicit breakpoint to cache your system prompt, while automatic caching handles the conversation:

```json
{
  "model": "claude-opus-4-8",
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "cache_control": { "type": "ephemeral" },
  "system": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "You are a helpful assistant.",
      "cache_control": { "type": "ephemeral" }
    }
  ],
  "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "What are the key terms?" }]
}
```

### What stays the same

Automatic caching uses the same underlying caching infrastructure. Pricing, minimum token thresholds, context ordering requirements, and the 20-block lookback window all apply the same as with explicit breakpoints.

### Edge cases

* If the last block already has an explicit `cache_control` with the same TTL, automatic caching is a no-op.
* If the last block has an explicit `cache_control` with a different TTL, the API returns a 400 error.
* If 4 explicit block-level breakpoints already exist, the API returns a 400 error (no slots left for automatic caching).
* If the last block is not eligible as an automatic cache breakpoint target, the system silently walks backwards to find the nearest eligible block. If none is found, caching is skipped.

<Note>
  Automatic caching is available on the Claude API, [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws), [Google Cloud](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai), and [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry). Amazon Bedrock does not support automatic caching.

## Explicit cache breakpoints

For more control over caching, you can place `cache_control` directly on individual content blocks. This is useful when you need to cache different sections that change at different frequencies, or need fine-grained control over exactly what gets cached.

### Structuring your prompt

Place static content (tool definitions, system instructions, context, examples) at the beginning of your prompt. Mark the end of the reusable content for caching using the `cache_control` parameter.

Cache prefixes are created in the following order: `tools`, `system`, then `messages`. This order forms a hierarchy where each level builds upon the previous ones.

#### How automatic prefix checking works

You can use just one cache breakpoint at the end of your static content, and the system will automatically find the longest prefix that a prior request already wrote to the cache. Understanding how this works helps you optimize your caching strategy.

**Three core principles:**

1. **Cache writes happen only at your breakpoint.** Marking a block with `cache_control` writes exactly one cache entry: a hash of the prefix ending at that block. The system does not write entries for any earlier position. Because the hash is cumulative, covering everything up to and including the breakpoint, changing any block at or before the breakpoint produces a different hash on the next request.

2. **Cache reads look backward for entries that prior requests wrote.** On each request the system computes the prefix hash at your breakpoint and checks for a matching cache entry. If none exists, it walks backward one block at a time, checking whether the prefix hash at each earlier position matches something already in the cache. It is looking for prior writes, not for stable content.

3. **The lookback window is 20 blocks.** The system checks at most 20 positions per breakpoint, counting the breakpoint itself as the first. If the system finds no matching entry in that window, checking stops (or resumes from the next explicit breakpoint, if any).

**Example: Lookback in a growing conversation**

You append new blocks each turn and set `cache_control` on the final block of each request:

* **Turn 1:** 10 blocks, breakpoint on block 10. No prior cache entries exist. The system writes an entry at block 10.
* **Turn 2:** 15 blocks, breakpoint on block 15. Block 15 has no entry, so the system walks back to block 10 and finds the turn-1 entry. Cache hit at block 10; the system processes only blocks 11 through 15 fresh and writes a new entry at block 15.
* **Turn 3:** 35 blocks, breakpoint on block 35. The system checks 20 positions (blocks 35 through 16) and finds nothing. The turn-2 entry at block 15 is one position outside the window, so there is no cache hit. Adding a second breakpoint at block 15 starts a second lookback window there, which finds the turn-2 entry.

**Common mistake: Breakpoint on content that changes every request**

Your prompt has a large static system context (blocks 1 through 5) followed by a per-request block containing a timestamp and the user message (block 6). You set `cache_control` on block 6:

* **Request 1:** Cache write at block 6. The hash includes the timestamp.
* **Request 2:** The timestamp differs, so the prefix hash at block 6 differs. The lookback walks through blocks 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, but the system never wrote an entry at any of those positions. No cache hit. You pay for a fresh cache write on every request and never get a read.

The lookback does not find stable content behind your breakpoint and cache it. It finds entries that prior requests already wrote, and writes happen only at breakpoints. Move `cache_control` to block 5, the last block that stays the same across requests, and every subsequent request reads the cached prefix. [Automatic caching](#automatic-caching) hits the same trap: it places the breakpoint on the last cacheable block, which in this structure is the one that changes every request, so use an explicit breakpoint on block 5 instead.

**Key takeaway:** Place `cache_control` on the last block whose prefix is identical across the requests you want to share a cache. In a growing conversation the final block works as long as each turn adds fewer than 20 blocks: earlier content never changes, so the next request's lookback finds the prior write. For a prompt with a varying suffix (timestamps, per-request context, the incoming message), place the breakpoint at the end of the static prefix, not on the varying block.

#### When to use multiple breakpoints

You can define up to 4 cache breakpoints if you want to:

* Cache different sections that change at different frequencies (for example, tools rarely change, but context updates daily)
* Have more control over exactly what gets cached
* Ensure a cache hit when a growing conversation pushes your breakpoint 20 or more blocks past the last cache write

<Note>
  **Important limitation:** The lookback can only find entries that earlier requests already wrote. If a growing conversation pushes your breakpoint 20 or more blocks past the last write, the lookback window misses it. Add a second breakpoint closer to that position from the start so a write accumulates there before you need it.
</Note>

### Understanding cache breakpoint costs

**Cache breakpoints themselves don't add any cost.** You are only charged for:

* **Cache writes:** When new content is written to the cache (25% more than base input tokens for 5-minute TTL)
* **Cache reads:** When cached content is used (10% of base input token price)
* **Regular input tokens:** For any uncached content

Adding more `cache_control` breakpoints doesn't increase your costs - you still pay the same amount based on what content is actually cached and read. The breakpoints simply give you control over what sections can be cached independently.

## Caching strategies and considerations

### Cache limitations

On the Claude API, [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws), [Google Cloud](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai), and [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry), the minimum cacheable prompt length is:

* 512 tokens for Claude Fable 5 and [Claude Mythos 5](https://anthropic.com/glasswing)
* 2,048 tokens for [Claude Mythos Preview](https://anthropic.com/glasswing) and Claude Opus 4.7
* 4,096 tokens for Claude Opus 4.6 and Claude Opus 4.5
* 1,024 tokens for Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Sonnet 5, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Opus 4.1 ([deprecated](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)), Claude Opus 4 ([retired, except on Google Cloud](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations)), and Claude Sonnet 4 ([retired, except on Bedrock and Google Cloud](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations))
* 4,096 tokens for Claude Haiku 4.5
* 2,048 tokens for Claude Haiku 3.5 ([retired, except on Google Cloud](/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations))

Model availability varies by platform, and so can the minimum for newly released models: on [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock), the minimum cacheable prompt length for Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 is 1,024 tokens.

Shorter prompts cannot be cached, even if marked with `cache_control`. Any requests to cache fewer than this number of tokens will be processed without caching, and no error is returned. To verify whether a prompt was cached, check the [response usage fields](#tracking-cache-performance): if both `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` are 0, the prompt was not cached (likely because it did not meet the minimum length requirement).

If your prompt falls just short of the minimum for your model and platform, expanding the cached content to reach the threshold is often worthwhile. Cache reads cost significantly less than uncached input tokens, so reaching the minimum can reduce costs for frequently reused prompts.

<Note>
  [Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock) is an AWS-operated platform. On Bedrock, see the [Bedrock prompt caching documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-caching.html) for the per-model minimums, failure behavior, and usage-field names that apply.
</Note>

For concurrent requests, note that a cache entry only becomes available after the first response begins. If you need cache hits for parallel requests, wait for the first response before sending subsequent requests.

Currently, "ephemeral" is the only supported cache type, which by default has a 5-minute lifetime.

### What can be cached

Most blocks in the request can be cached. This includes:

* Tools: Tool definitions in the `tools` array
* System messages: Content blocks in the `system` array
* Text messages: Content blocks in the `messages.content` array, for both user and assistant turns
* Images & Documents: Content blocks in the `messages.content` array, in user turns
* Tool use and tool results: Content blocks in the `messages.content` array, in both user and assistant turns

Each of these elements can be cached, either automatically or by marking them with `cache_control`.

### What cannot be cached

While most request blocks can be cached, there are some exceptions:

* Thinking blocks cannot be cached directly with `cache_control`. However, thinking blocks CAN be cached alongside other content when they appear in previous assistant turns. When cached this way, they DO count as input tokens when read from cache.

* Sub-content blocks (like [citations](/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations)) themselves cannot be cached directly. Instead, cache the top-level block.

  In the case of citations, the top-level document content blocks that serve as the source material for citations can be cached. This allows you to use prompt caching with citations effectively by caching the documents that citations will reference.

* Empty text blocks cannot be cached.

### What invalidates the cache

Modifications to cached content can invalidate some or all of the cache.

As described in [Structuring your prompt](#structuring-your-prompt), the cache follows the hierarchy: `tools` → `system` → `messages`. Changes at each level invalidate that level and all subsequent levels.

The following table shows which parts of the cache are invalidated by different types of changes. ✘ indicates that the cache is invalidated, while ✓ indicates that the cache remains valid.

<Note>
  On Claude Fable 5, [Claude Mythos 5](https://anthropic.com/glasswing), and Claude Opus 4.8, you can add a new system instruction partway through a conversation without invalidating the system or message caches. Append a `{"role": "system"}` message to `messages` instead of editing the top-level `system` field, so the cached prefix stays unchanged. This feature is not available on Claude Sonnet 5; use the top-level `system` field instead. See [Mid-conversation system messages](/docs/en/build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages).
</Note>

### Tracking cache performance

Monitor cache performance using these API response fields, within `usage` in the response (or `message_start` event if [streaming](/docs/en/build-with-claude/streaming)):

* `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Number of tokens written to the cache when creating a new entry.
* `cache_read_input_tokens`: Number of tokens retrieved from the cache for this request.
* `input_tokens`: Number of input tokens which were not read from or used to create a cache (that is, tokens after the last cache breakpoint).

<Note>
  **Understanding the token breakdown**

  The `input_tokens` field represents only the tokens that come **after the last cache breakpoint** in your request - not all the input tokens you sent.

  To calculate total input tokens:

  ```text wrap
  total_input_tokens = cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + input_tokens
  ```

  **Spatial explanation:**

  * `cache_read_input_tokens` = tokens before breakpoint already cached (reads)
  * `cache_creation_input_tokens` = tokens before breakpoint being cached now (writes)
  * `input_tokens` = tokens after your last breakpoint (not eligible for cache)

  **Example:** If you have a request with 100,000 tokens of cached content (read from cache), 0 tokens of new content being cached, and 50 tokens in your user message (after the cache breakpoint):

  * `cache_read_input_tokens`: 100,000
  * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: 0
  * `input_tokens`: 50
  * **Total input tokens processed:** 100,050 tokens

  This is important for understanding both costs and rate limits, as `input_tokens` will typically be much smaller than your total input when using caching effectively.
</Note>

### Caching with thinking blocks

When using [extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) with prompt caching, thinking blocks have special behavior:

**Automatic caching alongside other content:** While thinking blocks cannot be explicitly marked with `cache_control`, they get cached as part of the request content when you make subsequent API calls with tool results. This commonly happens during tool use when you pass thinking blocks back to continue the conversation.

**Input token counting:** When thinking blocks are read from cache, they count as input tokens in your usage metrics. This is important for cost calculation and token budgeting.

**Cache invalidation patterns:**

* Cache remains valid when only tool results are provided as user messages
* On Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+, thinking blocks are preserved by default even when non-tool-result user content is added, so the cache remains valid
* On earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models, cache gets invalidated when non-tool-result user content is added, causing all previous thinking blocks to be stripped from context
* This caching behavior occurs even without explicit `cache_control` markers

For more details on cache invalidation, see [What invalidates the cache](#what-invalidates-the-cache).

**Example with tool use:**

```text wrap
Request 1: User: "What's the weather in Paris?"
Response: [thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1]

Request 2:
User: ["What's the weather in Paris?"],
Assistant: [thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1],
User: [tool_result_1, cache=True]
Response: [thinking_block_2] + [text block 2]
# Request 2 caches its request content (not the response)
# The cache includes: user message, thinking_block_1, tool_use block 1, and tool_result_1

Request 3:
User: ["What's the weather in Paris?"],
Assistant: [thinking_block_1] + [tool_use block 1],
User: [tool_result_1, cache=True],
Assistant: [thinking_block_2] + [text block 2],
User: [Text response, cache=True]
# On earlier Opus/Sonnet and all Haiku models, non-tool-result user block causes prior thinking blocks to be stripped; on Opus 4.5+/Sonnet 4.6+ they are kept
```

On earlier Opus/Sonnet models and all Haiku models, all previous thinking blocks are removed from context at this point. On Opus 4.5+ and Sonnet 4.6+, prior thinking blocks are kept by default and remain part of the cached prefix.

### Cache storage and sharing

<Warning>
  As of February 5, 2026, prompt caching uses [workspace](/docs/en/manage-claude/workspaces)-level isolation instead of organization-level isolation. Caches are isolated per workspace, ensuring data separation between workspaces within the same organization. This applies to the Claude API, Claude Platform on AWS, and Microsoft Foundry; Bedrock and Google Cloud maintain organization-level cache isolation. If you use multiple workspaces, review your caching strategy to account for this difference.
</Warning>

* **Organization and workspace isolation:** Caches are isolated between organizations. Different organizations never share caches, even if they use identical prompts. As of February 5, 2026, caches are also isolated per workspace within an organization on the Claude API, Claude Platform on AWS, and Microsoft Foundry; Bedrock and Google Cloud continue to use organization-level isolation only.

* **Exact matching:** Cache hits require 100% identical prompt segments, including all text and images up to and including the block marked with cache control.

* **Output token generation:** Prompt caching has no effect on output token generation. The response you receive is identical to what you would get if prompt caching were not used.

### Best practices for effective caching

To optimize prompt caching performance:

* Start with [automatic caching](#automatic-caching) for multi-turn conversations. It handles breakpoint management automatically.
* Use [explicit block-level breakpoints](#explicit-cache-breakpoints) when you need to cache different sections with different change frequencies.
* Cache stable, reusable content like system instructions, background information, large contexts, or frequent tool definitions.
* Place cached content at the prompt's beginning for best performance.
* Use cache breakpoints strategically to separate different cacheable prefix sections.
* Place the breakpoint on the last block that stays identical across requests. For a prompt with a static prefix and a varying suffix (timestamps, per-request context, the incoming message), that is the end of the prefix, not the varying block.
* Regularly analyze cache hit rates and adjust your strategy as needed.

### Optimizing for different use cases

Tailor your prompt caching strategy to your scenario:

* Conversational agents: Reduce cost and latency for extended conversations, especially those with long instructions or uploaded documents.
* Coding assistants: Improve autocomplete and codebase Q\&A by keeping relevant sections or a summarized version of the codebase in the prompt.
* Large document processing: Incorporate complete long-form material including images in your prompt without increasing response latency.
* Detailed instruction sets: Share extensive lists of instructions, procedures, and examples to fine-tune Claude's responses. Developers often include an example or two in the prompt, but with prompt caching you can get even better performance by including 20+ diverse examples of high quality answers.
* Agentic tool use: Enhance performance for scenarios involving multiple tool calls and iterative code changes, where each step typically requires a new API call.
* Talk to books, papers, documentation, podcast transcripts, and other longform content: Bring any knowledge base alive by embedding the entire document(s) into the prompt, and letting users ask it questions.

### Troubleshooting common issues

If experiencing unexpected behavior:

<Tip>
  [Cache diagnostics](/docs/en/build-with-claude/cache-diagnostics) (beta) has the API compare consecutive requests and report exactly where the prompt prefix diverged, which automatically handles many of the steps in this list.
</Tip>

* Ensure cached sections are identical across calls. For explicit breakpoints, verify that `cache_control` markers are in the same locations
* Check that calls are made within the cache lifetime (5 minutes by default)
* Verify that `tool_choice` and image usage remain consistent between calls
* Validate that you are caching at least the minimum number of tokens for your model and platform (see [Cache limitations](#cache-limitations))
* Confirm your breakpoint is on a block that stays identical across requests. Cache writes happen only at the breakpoint, and if that block changes (timestamps, per-request context, the incoming message), the prefix hash never matches. The lookback does not find stable content behind the breakpoint; it only finds entries that earlier requests wrote at their own breakpoints
* Verify that the keys in your `tool_use` content blocks have stable ordering as some languages (for example, Swift, Go) randomize key order during JSON conversion, breaking caches
* Use [cache diagnostics](/docs/en/build-with-claude/cache-diagnostics) to have the API compare consecutive requests and report which part of the prompt diverged

<Note>
  Changes to `tool_choice` or the presence/absence of images anywhere in the prompt will invalidate the cache, requiring a new cache entry to be created. For more details on cache invalidation, see [What invalidates the cache](#what-invalidates-the-cache).
</Note>

## 1-hour cache duration

If you find that 5 minutes is too short, Anthropic also offers a 1-hour cache duration [at additional cost](#pricing).

<Note>
  The 1-hour cache duration is available on the Claude API, [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-amazon-bedrock), [Amazon Bedrock (Opus 4.6 and earlier)](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-amazon-bedrock-legacy), [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws), [Google Cloud](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-on-vertex-ai), and [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry).
</Note>

To use the extended cache, include `ttl` in the `cache_control` definition like this:

```json
"cache_control": {
  "type": "ephemeral",
  "ttl": "1h"
}
```

The response includes detailed cache information like the following:

```json Output
{
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 2048,
    "cache_read_input_tokens": 1800,
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": 248,
    "output_tokens": 503,

    "cache_creation": {
      "ephemeral_5m_input_tokens": 148,
      "ephemeral_1h_input_tokens": 100
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the current `cache_creation_input_tokens` field equals the sum of the values in the `cache_creation` object.

If you see `ephemeral_5m_input_tokens` writes you didn't request while using server tools such as web search, see [Tool use with prompt caching](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-use-with-prompt-caching#server-tool-results-are-cached-automatically).

### When to use the 1-hour cache

If you have prompts that are used at a regular cadence (that is, system prompts that are used more frequently than every 5 minutes), continue to use the 5-minute cache, because this will continue to be refreshed at no additional charge.

The 1-hour cache is best used in the following scenarios:

* When you have prompts that are likely used less frequently than 5 minutes, but more frequently than every hour. For example, when an agentic side-agent will take longer than 5 minutes, or when storing a long chat conversation with a user and you generally expect that user may not respond in the next 5 minutes.
* When latency is important and your follow up prompts may be sent beyond 5 minutes.
* When you want to improve your rate limit utilization, because cache hits are not deducted against your rate limit.

<Note>
  The 5-minute and 1-hour cache behave the same with respect to latency. You will generally see improved time-to-first-token for long documents.
</Note>

### Mixing different TTLs

You can use both 1-hour and 5-minute cache controls in the same request, but with an important constraint: Cache entries with longer TTL must appear before shorter TTLs (that is, a 1-hour cache entry must appear before any 5-minute cache entries).

When mixing TTLs, the API determines three billing locations in your prompt:

1. Position `A`: The token count at the highest cache hit (or 0 if no hits).
2. Position `B`: The token count at the highest 1-hour `cache_control` block after `A` (or equals `A` if none exist).
3. Position `C`: The token count at the last `cache_control` block.

<Note>
  If `B` and/or `C` are larger than `A`, they will necessarily be cache misses, because `A` is the highest cache hit.
</Note>

You'll be charged for:

1. Cache read tokens for `A`.
2. 1-hour cache write tokens for `(B - A)`.
3. 5-minute cache write tokens for `(C - B)`.

Here are three examples. This depicts the input tokens of 3 requests, each of which has different cache hits and cache misses. Each has a different calculated pricing, shown in the colored boxes, as a result. ![Mixing TTLs Diagram](/docs/images/prompt-cache-mixed-ttl.svg)

***

## Pre-warming the cache

Cache pre-warming lets you load your system prompt or tool definitions into the prompt cache before a user triggers a real request. This eliminates the cache-miss latency penalty on the first user interaction, reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) for latency-sensitive applications.

### How it works

Set `max_tokens: 0` in your request. The API reads your prompt into the model and writes the cache at any `cache_control` breakpoint, then returns immediately without generating any output. The response has an empty `content` array, `stop_reason: "max_tokens"`, and a fully populated `usage` block.

Place the `cache_control` breakpoint on the last block that is shared with the follow-up request (typically your system prompt or tool definitions), not on the placeholder user message. Otherwise the cache entry is keyed to the placeholder and the follow-up request won't hit it. This means using an [explicit cache breakpoint](#explicit-cache-breakpoints) rather than [automatic caching](#automatic-caching), since automatic caching places the breakpoint on the last block, which here is the placeholder. The placeholder user message can be any string with non-whitespace content (the examples here use `"warmup"`); its content is read into the model but never answered.

<Note>
  A pre-warm request incurs a **cache write** charge if the prefix is not already cached, the same as any other request. Check `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens` in the response to confirm a write occurred. Zero output tokens are billed.

  ```
</CodeGroup>

Keep in mind that the cache TTL still applies. For the default 5-minute cache, send a new pre-warm request at least every 5 minutes to keep the cache warm. For longer gaps between user requests, use the [1-hour cache duration](#1-hour-cache-duration) instead.

### Limitations

A `max_tokens: 0` request is rejected with an `invalid_request_error` if any of the following are set, since each implies output that a zero-token budget cannot produce:

* `stream: true`
* [Extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) (`thinking.type: "enabled"`)
* [Structured outputs](/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) (`output_config.format`)
* `tool_choice` of `{"type": "tool", ...}` or `{"type": "any"}`

`max_tokens: 0` is also rejected inside a [Message Batches](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing) request. Pre-warming targets time-to-first-token, which does not apply to batch processing, and a cache entry written during batch processing would likely expire before the follow-up request runs.

### Replacing the max\_tokens=1 workaround

Before `max_tokens: 0` was available, some applications used `max_tokens: 1` warm-up calls to achieve the same effect. The `max_tokens: 0` approach is preferred: no output is produced, so there is no single-token reply to discard, no output tokens are billed, and the intent of the request is unambiguous.

## Prompt caching examples

To help you get started with prompt caching, the [prompt caching cookbook](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/misc-prompt-caching) provides detailed examples and best practices.

The following code snippets showcase various prompt caching patterns. These examples demonstrate how to implement caching in different scenarios, helping you understand the practical applications of this feature:

    This example demonstrates basic prompt caching usage, caching the full text of the legal agreement as a prefix while keeping the user instruction uncached.

    For the first request:

    * `input_tokens`: Number of tokens in the user message only
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Number of tokens in the entire system message, including the legal document
    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: 0 (no cache hit on first request)

    For subsequent requests within the cache lifetime:

    * `input_tokens`: Number of tokens in the user message only
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: 0 (no new cache creation)
    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: Number of tokens in the entire cached system message
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Caching tool definitions">
    Tool definitions can be cached by placing `cache_control` on the last tool in your `tools` array. All tools defined before and including that tool are cached as a single prefix.

    ```json
    {
      "model": "claude-opus-4-8",
      "max_tokens": 1024,
      "tools": [
        {
          "name": "get_weather",
          "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
          "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": { "location": { "type": "string" } },
            "required": ["location"]
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "get_time",
          "description": "Get the current time in a given time zone",
          "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": { "timezone": { "type": "string" } },
            "required": ["timezone"]
          },
          "cache_control": { "type": "ephemeral" }
        }
      ],
      "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "What is the weather and time in New York?" }]
    }
    ```

    On the first request, `cache_creation_input_tokens` reflects the token count of all tool definitions. On subsequent requests within the cache lifetime, those tokens appear under `cache_read_input_tokens` instead.

    For detailed interaction between tool definitions, `defer_loading`, and cache invalidation, see [Tool use with prompt caching](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-use-with-prompt-caching).

    This example demonstrates how to use prompt caching in a multi-turn conversation.

    During each turn, the final block of the final message is marked with `cache_control` so the conversation can be incrementally cached. The system automatically looks up and uses the longest previously cached sequence of blocks for follow-up messages. That is, blocks that were previously marked with a `cache_control` block are later not marked with this, but they will still be considered a cache hit (and also a cache refresh!) if they are hit within 5 minutes.

    In addition, note that the `cache_control` parameter is placed on the system message. This is to ensure that if this gets evicted from the cache (after not being used for more than 5 minutes), it will get added back to the cache on the next request.

    This approach is useful for maintaining context in ongoing conversations without repeatedly processing the same information.

    When this is set up properly, you should see the following in the usage response of each request:

    * `input_tokens`: Number of tokens in the new user message (will be minimal)
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Number of tokens in the new assistant and user turns
    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: Number of tokens in the conversation up to the previous turn

    This comprehensive example demonstrates how to use all 4 available cache breakpoints to optimize different parts of your prompt:

    1. **Tools cache** (cache breakpoint 1): The `cache_control` parameter on the last tool definition caches all tool definitions.

    2. **Reusable instructions cache** (cache breakpoint 2): The static instructions in the system prompt are cached separately. These instructions rarely change between requests.

    3. **RAG context cache** (cache breakpoint 3): The knowledge base documents are cached independently, allowing you to update the RAG documents without invalidating the tools or instructions cache.

    4. **Conversation history cache** (cache breakpoint 4): The final user message is marked with `cache_control` to enable incremental caching of the conversation as it progresses.

    This approach provides maximum flexibility:

    * If you append a new turn to the conversation without changing earlier content, all four cache segments are reused
    * If you update the RAG documents but keep the same tools and instructions, the first two cache segments are reused
    * If you change the conversation but keep the same tools, instructions, and documents, the first three segments are reused
    * Changes at any breakpoint invalidate that segment and everything after it, while earlier cached segments remain valid

    For the first request:

    * `input_tokens`: Minimal (tokens after the final cache breakpoint, near 0 in this example)
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Tokens in all cached segments (tools + instructions + RAG documents + conversation history)
    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: 0 (no cache hits)

    For subsequent requests with only a new user message (and the fourth breakpoint moved to that new final message, as in the example):

    * `input_tokens`: Minimal (tokens after the final cache breakpoint, near 0 in this example)
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Tokens in the new user message and the previous assistant turn (the new conversation segment being cached)
    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: All previously cached tokens (tools + instructions + RAG documents + previous conversation)

    This pattern is especially powerful for:

    * RAG applications with large document contexts
    * Agent systems that use multiple tools
    * Long-running conversations that need to maintain context
    * Applications that need to optimize different parts of the prompt independently

## Data retention

Prompt caching (both automatic and explicit) is ZDR eligible. Anthropic does not store the raw text of your prompts or Claude's responses.

KV (key-value) cache representations and cryptographic hashes of cached content are held in memory only and are not stored at rest. Cached entries have a minimum lifetime of 5 minutes (standard) or 1 hour (extended), after which they are promptly, though not immediately, deleted. Cache entries are isolated between organizations and, on the Claude API, Claude Platform on AWS, and Microsoft Foundry, between workspaces within an organization.

For ZDR eligibility across all features, see [API and data retention](/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention).

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need multiple cache breakpoints or is one at the end sufficient?">
    **In most cases, a single cache breakpoint at the end of your static content is sufficient.** Cache writes happen only at the block you mark. Place it on the last block that stays identical across requests, and every subsequent request reads that same entry. If a later block varies per request (a timestamp, the incoming message), keep the breakpoint before it, on the last stable block.

    You only need multiple breakpoints if:

    * A growing conversation pushes your breakpoint 20 or more blocks past the last cache write, putting the prior entry outside the lookback window
    * You want to cache sections that update at different frequencies independently
    * You need explicit control over what gets cached for cost optimization

    Example: If you have system instructions (rarely change) and RAG context (changes daily), you might use two breakpoints to cache them separately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do cache breakpoints add extra cost?">
    No, cache breakpoints themselves are free. You only pay for:

    * Writing content to cache (25% more than base input tokens for 5-minute TTL)
    * Reading from cache (10% of base input token price)
    * Regular input tokens for uncached content

    The number of breakpoints doesn't affect pricing - only the amount of content cached and read matters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I calculate total input tokens from the usage fields?">
    The usage response includes three separate input token fields that together represent your total input:

    ```text wrap
    total_input_tokens = cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + input_tokens
    ```

    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: Tokens retrieved from cache (everything before cache breakpoints that was cached)
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: New tokens being written to cache (at cache breakpoints)
    * `input_tokens`: Tokens **after the last cache breakpoint** that aren't cached

    **Important:** `input_tokens` does NOT represent all input tokens - only the portion after your last cache breakpoint. If you have cached content, `input_tokens` will typically be much smaller than your total input.

    **Example:** With a 200k token document cached and a 50 token user question:

    * `cache_read_input_tokens`: 200,000
    * `cache_creation_input_tokens`: 0
    * `input_tokens`: 50
    * **Total:** 200,050 tokens

    This breakdown is critical for understanding both your costs and rate limit usage. See [Tracking cache performance](#tracking-cache-performance) for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the cache lifetime?">
    The cache's default minimum lifetime (TTL) is 5 minutes. This lifetime is refreshed each time the cached content is used.

    If you find that 5 minutes is too short, Anthropic also offers a [1-hour cache TTL](#1-hour-cache-duration).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many cache breakpoints can I use?">
    You can define up to 4 cache breakpoints (using `cache_control` parameters) in your prompt.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is prompt caching available for all models?">
    Prompt caching is supported on all [active Claude models](/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does prompt caching work with extended thinking?">
    Cached system prompts and tools will be reused when thinking parameters change. However, thinking changes (enabling/disabling or budget changes) will invalidate previously cached prompt prefixes with messages content.

    For more details on cache invalidation, see [What invalidates the cache](#what-invalidates-the-cache).

    For more on extended thinking, including its interaction with tool use and prompt caching, see the [extended thinking](/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#extended-thinking-and-prompt-caching) documentation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I enable prompt caching?">
    The easiest way is to add `"cache_control": {"type": "ephemeral"}` at the top level of your request body ([automatic caching](#automatic-caching)). Alternatively, include at least one `cache_control` breakpoint on individual content blocks ([explicit cache breakpoints](#explicit-cache-breakpoints)).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use prompt caching with other API features?">
    Yes, prompt caching can be used alongside other API features like tool use and vision capabilities. However, changing whether there are images in a prompt or modifying tool use settings will break the cache.

    For more details on cache invalidation, see [What invalidates the cache](#what-invalidates-the-cache).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does prompt caching affect pricing?">
    Prompt caching introduces a new pricing structure where 5-minute cache writes cost 25% more than base input tokens, 1-hour cache writes cost 2x base input tokens, and cache hits cost only 10% of the base input token price.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manually clear the cache?">
    Currently, there's no way to manually clear the cache. Cached prefixes automatically expire after a minimum of 5 minutes of inactivity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I track the effectiveness of my caching strategy?">
    You can monitor cache performance using the `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens` fields in the API response.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What can break the cache?">
    See [What invalidates the cache](#what-invalidates-the-cache) for more details on cache invalidation, including a list of changes that require creating a new cache entry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does prompt caching handle privacy and data separation?">
    Prompt caching is designed with strong privacy and data separation measures:

    1. Cache keys are generated using a cryptographic hash of the prompts up to the cache control point. This means only requests with identical prompts can access a specific cache.

    2. On the Claude API, Claude Platform on AWS, and Microsoft Foundry, caches are isolated per workspace within an organization. On Bedrock and Google Cloud, caches are isolated per organization. In every case, caches are never shared across organizations, even for identical prompts. See [Cache storage and sharing](#cache-storage-and-sharing) for details.

    3. The caching mechanism is designed to maintain the integrity and privacy of each unique conversation or context.

    4. It's safe to use `cache_control` anywhere in your prompts. For caching to produce reads, place the breakpoint at the end of a stable prefix: placing it on a block that changes every request (such as a timestamp or the user's arbitrary input) writes a fresh entry each time and never hits.

    These measures ensure that prompt caching maintains data privacy and security while offering performance benefits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use prompt caching with the Batches API?">
    Yes, it is possible to use prompt caching with your [Batches API](/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing) requests. However, because asynchronous batch requests can be processed concurrently and in any order, cache hits are provided on a best-effort basis.

    The [1-hour cache](#1-hour-cache-duration) can help improve your cache hits. The most cost effective way of using it is the following:

    * Gather a set of message requests that have a shared prefix.
    * Send a batch request with a single request that has this shared prefix and a 1-hour cache block. This writes the prefix to the 1-hour cache.
    * As soon as this is complete, submit the rest of the requests. You will have to monitor the job to know when it completes.

    This is typically better than using the 5-minute cache because it's common for batch requests to take between 5 minutes and 1 hour to complete.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why am I seeing the error `AttributeError: 'Beta' object has no attribute 'prompt_caching'` in Python?">
