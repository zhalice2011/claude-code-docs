## List RBAC Groups

**get** `/v1/organizations/rbac_groups`

List RBAC Groups in the Claude Enterprise tenant.

The RBAC Groups API is in beta and available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. Requests must send the `ce-user-management-2026-07-13` value in the `anthropic-beta` header.

### Query Parameters

- `limit: optional number`

  Number of items to return per page.

  Defaults to `20`. Ranges from `1` to `1000`.

- `page: optional string`

  Optionally set to the `next_page` token from the previous response.

### Header Parameters

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of string`

  Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.

  To use multiple betas, use a comma separated list like `beta1,beta2` or specify the header multiple times for each beta.

### Returns

- `data: array of RbacGroup`

  - `id: string`

    ID of the RBAC Group.

  - `created_at: string`

    RFC 3339 timestamp of when the RBAC Group was created.

  - `name: string`

    Name of the RBAC Group. Not uniqueness-enforced.

  - `roles: array of string`

    RBAC Role IDs attached to this RBAC Group. Role attachment is managed in the admin settings and is read-only on this API. `null` means role data was temporarily unavailable — retry to distinguish from an empty list.

  - `source_type: "direct" or "scim"`

    How the RBAC Group was created: `"direct"` for groups created directly (for example, in the organization's admin settings), `"scim"` for groups provisioned by the identity provider.

    - `"direct"`

    - `"scim"`

  - `type: "rbac_group"`

    Object type.

    For RBAC Groups, this is always `"rbac_group"`.

    - `"rbac_group"`

  - `updated_at: string`

    RFC 3339 timestamp of when the RBAC Group was last updated.

- `has_more: boolean`

  Indicates if there are more results in the requested page direction.

- `next_page: string`

  Token to provide in as `page` in the subsequent request to retrieve the next page of data.
