# Set Plugin Installation Setting

**POST** `/v1/organizations/plugins/{plugin_id}/installation_settings/{target}`

Set or change an organization-owned Plugin's installation setting for the whole
organization or for one RBAC Group.

Writing the value a target already holds of its own changes nothing.

A member-owned Plugin has shares instead of installation settings, so this path
returns 404 for one.

Send a Plugin's installation-setting writes one at a time. If several writes for the
same Plugin arrive at the same time, the server handles them one after another and
can answer some of them with `503` instead of applying them. That `503` carries
`x-should-retry: true`, and the write is safe to repeat: wait a second or two, then
send it again.

**Accepted credentials:** an Admin API key with the `write:plugins` scope.

Every request must include the beta header `anthropic-beta: ce-plugins-2026-09-01`. A request without it returns `404`, exactly as if the endpoint did not exist. The Plugins API is in beta and is available to Claude Enterprise organizations only. It is not available to Claude Platform (Claude Console) organizations, or to organizations with HIPAA readiness enabled.

## Path parameters

- `plugin_id: string`

  ID of the Plugin (prefixed `plugin_`).

- `target: string`

  The target whose setting is written: the literal `organization` for the Plugin's organization-wide setting, or an RBAC Group's ID (prefixed `rbac_group_`) for that group's own setting. Writing the `organization` target stops the Plugin from inheriting its marketplace's default, even when the value written equals that default.

## Headers

- `"anthropic-beta": optional array of AnthropicBeta`

  This endpoint is in beta: requests must send `ce-plugins-2026-09-01` in this header.

  - `"available"`

  - `"not_available"`

## Returns

- `BetaPluginInstallationSetting object`

  - `type: "plugin_installation_setting"`

    Always `plugin_installation_setting`.

    default: plugin_installation_setting

  - `created_at: string`

    format: date-time

  - `installation_preference: "auto_install" or "available" or "not_available" or "required"`

    The setting the target holds for this Plugin. One of `required`, `auto_install`, `available`, `not_available`; a value this API does not yet name is returned as stored.

    - `"auto_install"`

    - `"available"`

    - `"not_available"`

    - `"required"`

  - `plugin_id: string`

    The Plugin's ID.

  - `target: BetaPluginTargetOrganization or BetaPluginTargetRBACGroup or BetaPluginTargetOrganizationMember`

    Whose setting this is: `organization` (the Plugin's own organization-wide setting) or `rbac_group` (one RBAC Group's own setting); `organization_member` does not occur here.

    - `BetaPluginTargetOrganization object`

      - `type: "organization"`

        Every member of the organization.

        default: organization

    - `BetaPluginTargetRBACGroup object`
