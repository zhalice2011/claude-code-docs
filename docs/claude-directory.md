- Project uses custom Result<T, E> type, not exceptions
- Auth middleware expects Bearer token in Authorization header
- Tests use factory functions in test/factories/

## Recurring issues
- Missing null checks on API responses (src/api/*)
- Unhandled promise rejections in background jobs`

Claude Code reads instructions, settings, skills, subagents, and memory from your project directory and from `~/.claude` in your home directory. Commit project files to git to share them with your team; files in `~/.claude` are personal configuration that applies across all your projects.

On Windows, `~/.claude` resolves to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`. If you set [`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`](/docs/en/env-vars), every `~/.claude` path on this page lives under that directory instead.

Most users only edit `CLAUDE.md` and `settings.json`. The rest of the directory is optional: add skills, rules, or subagents as you need them.

## Explore the directory

Click files in the tree to see what each one does, when it loads, and an example.

<ClaudeExplorer />

## What's not shown

The explorer covers files you author and edit. A few related files live elsewhere:

| File                    | Location                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `CLAUDE.local.md`       | Project root               | Your private preferences for this project, loaded alongside CLAUDE.md. Create it manually and add it to `.gitignore`.                                                                                                                                               |
| Installed plugins       | `~/.claude/plugins`        | Cloned marketplaces, installed plugin versions, and per-plugin data, managed by `claude plugin` commands. Orphaned versions are deleted 14 days after a plugin update or uninstall. See [plugin caching](/docs/en/plugins-reference#plugin-caching-and-file-resolution). |

`~/.claude` also holds data Claude Code writes as you work: transcripts, prompt history, file snapshots, caches, and logs. See [application data](#application-data) below.

## File reference

This table lists every file the explorer covers. Project-scope files live in your repo under `.claude/` (or at the root for `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, and `.worktreeinclude`). Global-scope files live in `~/.claude/` and apply across all projects.

<Note>
  Several things can override what you put in these files:

  * [Managed settings](/docs/en/server-managed-settings) deployed by your organization take precedence over everything
  * CLI flags like `--permission-mode` or `--settings` override `settings.json` for that session
  * Some environment variables take precedence over their equivalent setting, but this varies: check the [environment variables reference](/docs/en/env-vars) for each one

  See [settings precedence](/docs/en/settings#settings-precedence) for the full order.

## Troubleshoot configuration

If a setting, hook, or file isn't taking effect, see [Debug your configuration](/docs/en/debug-your-config) for the inspection commands and a symptom-first lookup table.

## Application data

Beyond the config you author, `~/.claude` holds data Claude Code writes during sessions. These files are plaintext. Anything that passes through a tool lands in a transcript on disk: file contents, command output, pasted text.

### Cleaned up automatically

Files in the paths below are deleted on startup once they're older than [`cleanupPeriodDays`](/docs/en/settings#available-settings). The default is 30 days.

`sessions/` holds one small file per running session, used to detect concurrent sessions and crashes. It isn't part of the age-based sweep: Claude Code removes each file when its session exits and clears crash leftovers on the next launch.

### Kept until you delete them

The following paths are not covered by automatic cleanup and persist indefinitely.

| Path under `~/.claude/` | Contents                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `history.jsonl`         | Every prompt you've typed, with timestamp and project path. Used for up-arrow recall.                                                                                           |
| `stats-cache.json`      | Aggregated token and cost counts shown by `/usage`                                                                                                                              |
| `remote-settings.json`  | Cached copy of [server-managed settings](/docs/en/server-managed-settings) for your organization. Only present when your organization has configured them. Refreshed on each launch. |
| `cache/changelog.md`    | Cached copy of the Claude Code changelog, used to show release notes after an update. Refreshed in the background.                                                              |
| `policy-limits.json`    | Cached feature policy settings for your organization. Only present for some account types. Refreshed automatically.                                                             |

Other small cache and lock files appear depending on which features you use and are safe to delete.

### Plaintext storage

Transcripts and history are not encrypted at rest. OS file permissions are the only protection. If a tool reads a `.env` file or a command prints a credential, that value is written to `projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl`. To reduce exposure:

* Lower `cleanupPeriodDays` to shorten how long transcripts are kept
* Set the [`CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_PROMPT_HISTORY`](/docs/en/env-vars) environment variable to skip writing transcripts and prompt history in any mode. In non-interactive mode, you can instead pass `--no-session-persistence` alongside `-p`, or set `persistSession: false` in the Agent SDK.
* Use [permission rules](/docs/en/permissions) to deny reads of credential files

### Clear local data

Run `claude project purge` to delete the state Claude Code holds for one project. The command requires Claude Code v2.1.124 or later. It deletes:

* Transcripts and auto memory under `projects/`
* Per-session `tasks/`, `debug/`, and `file-history/` entries
* Matching prompt lines in `history.jsonl`
* The project's entry in `~/.claude.json`

The command prints the full deletion plan and asks for confirmation before removing anything.

The examples below use `~/work/my-repo` as a placeholder. Replace it with the path to your project. If no state matches the path, the command prints an error and exits with status 1.

Preview the plan without deleting anything:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo --dry-run
```

The plan lists each matching item and why it is included:

```text theme={null}
Purge plan for /home/user/work/my-repo:

  dir:    /home/user/.claude/projects/-home-user-work-my-repo
           project transcripts (.jsonl) and memory/
  config: projects["/home/user/work/my-repo"]
           project entry in ~/.claude.json (trust, history, MCP servers)
  filter: /home/user/.claude/history.jsonl
           12 prompt(s) typed in this project

shell-snapshots/ are not project-scoped and will not be touched
backups/ may still contain this project entry in old .claude.json snapshots (/home/user/.claude/backups); at most 5 are kept and they rotate out automatically
Dry run: 3 item(s) would be deleted.
```

Delete with a single confirmation prompt:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo
```

The command prints the same plan, then asks `Delete 3 item(s) for /home/user/work/my-repo? This cannot be undone. [y/N]` and deletes only if you answer `y`.

Omit the path to pick a project from an interactive list.

Skip the confirmation prompt for use in scripts:

```bash theme={null}
claude project purge ~/work/my-repo --yes
```

Pass `--all` instead of a path to purge state for every project at once, which deletes `history.jsonl` outright rather than filtering it. Pass `-i` to step through the deletion plan one item at a time.

The command leaves `shell-snapshots/` and `backups/` alone because those are not project-scoped, and warns about them in the plan output.

You can also delete any of the application-data paths above by hand. New sessions are unaffected. The table below shows what you lose for past sessions.
