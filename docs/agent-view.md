# Manage multiple agents with agent view

> Dispatch and manage many Claude Code sessions from one screen. Agent view shows what every session is doing and which ones need your input.

Agent view, opened with `claude agents`, is one screen for all your background sessions: what's running, what needs your input, and what's done. Dispatch new sessions, watch their state at a glance instead of scrolling through transcripts, and step in only when one needs you. Each background session is a full Claude Code conversation that keeps running without a terminal attached, so you can open it, reply, and leave whenever you want.

Use agent view when you have several independent tasks Claude can work on without you watching every step. Dispatch a bug fix, a pull request review, and a flaky-test investigation as three rows, keep working in another window, and check back when a row shows it needs you or has a result.

When you want to work more directly in any agent's session, attach to the row to enter the full conversation.

To compare agent view with subagents, agent teams, and worktrees, see [Run agents in parallel](/en/agents).

<Note>
  Agent view is in research preview and requires Claude Code v2.1.139 or later. Check your version with `claude --version`. The interface and keyboard shortcuts may change as the feature evolves.

## Quick start

This walkthrough covers the core agent view loop: dispatch a task, watch its row update as Claude works, peek to check on it and reply, and attach for the full conversation. The session you dispatch keeps running after you close agent view, so you can leave and come back to it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open agent view">
    From your shell, run:

    ```bash theme={null}
    claude agents
    ```

    Agent view opens with an input at the bottom and a table that fills in as sessions start. Press `Esc` at any time to return to your shell. Your sessions keep running while you're away and reappear the next time you open agent view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dispatch a session">
    Type a prompt describing a task and press `Enter`. A new background session starts on that task and appears as a row showing whether it's working, waiting on you, or done. The new session uses the model shown in the agent view header and the same [permission mode](#permission-mode-model-and-effort) you'd get running `claude` in that directory.

    Every prompt you enter here starts its own new session. Typing another prompt and pressing `Enter` launches a second session alongside the first rather than sending a follow-up to it. You can run several in parallel this way.

    Each session uses your subscription quota independently, so see [Limitations](#limitations) before dispatching many at once.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Peek and reply">
    Select a row with the arrow keys and press `Space` to open the peek panel. It shows the session's most recent output, or the question it's waiting on, rather than the full transcript. Type a reply and press `Enter` to send it without leaving agent view.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach and detach">
    Press `Enter` or `→` on a row to attach when you want the full conversation. The session takes over the terminal as a full interactive Claude Code session. Press `←` on an empty prompt to detach and return to the table.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bring an existing session in">
    To move a session you already have open into agent view, run `/bg` inside it, or press `←` on an empty prompt to background it and open agent view in one step. The session keeps running and appears as a row alongside the ones you dispatched.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can use `claude agents` as your primary entry point instead of `claude`: dispatch every task from agent view, attach when you want the full conversation, and press `←` to return to the table.

## Monitor sessions with agent view

Run `claude agents` to open agent view. It takes over the full terminal and lists every session grouped by state, with pinned sessions and the ones that need you at the top. Each row shows the session's name, current activity, and how long ago it last changed.

By default the list shows every background session you've started, across all your projects. A session working in one repository and another in a different worktree both appear here, regardless of which directory you opened agent view from. To narrow the list to one project, pass `--cwd`, which requires Claude Code v2.1.141 or later:

```bash theme={null}
claude agents --cwd ~/projects/my-app
```

This shows only sessions started under that directory. A session that has [moved into a worktree](#how-file-edits-are-isolated) under `~/projects/my-app/.claude/worktrees/` still counts as belonging to `~/projects/my-app`.

Interactive sessions you have open in other terminals don't appear until you [background them](#from-inside-a-session). [Subagents](/en/sub-agents) and [teammates](/en/agent-teams) a session spawns aren't listed as separate rows.

### Read session state

Each row starts with an icon whose color and animation show the session's state:

| State       | Icon shows as | What it means                                                            |
| :---------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Working     | Animated      | Claude is actively running tools or generating a response                |
| Needs input | Yellow        | Claude is waiting on a specific question or permission decision from you |
| Idle        | Dimmed        | The session has nothing to do and is ready for your next prompt          |
| Completed   | Green         | The task finished successfully                                           |
| Failed      | Red           | The task ended with an error                                             |
| Stopped     | Grey          | The session was stopped with `Ctrl+X` or `claude stop`                   |

Separately, the icon's shape shows whether the underlying process is running:

| Shape               | What it means                                                                                                     |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `✻` or animated `✽` | The session process is alive and replies immediately                                                              |
| `∙`                 | The process has exited. You can still peek, reply, or attach, and Claude restarts from where it left off          |
| `✢`                 | A [`/loop`](/en/scheduled-tasks) session sleeping between iterations. The row shows its run count and a countdown |

The `PR #N` label that can appear at the right edge of a row is the [pull request the session opened](#pull-request-status), not part of the state icon. When a session has opened more than one pull request, the label shows a count instead, such as `3 PRs`.

The terminal tab title shows the awaiting-input count while agent view is open: `2 awaiting input · claude agents` when sessions need input, or `claude agents` when none do.

Background sessions don't need any terminal open to keep working. A separate [supervisor process](#the-supervisor-process) runs them, so you can close agent view, close your shell, or start a new interactive session and your dispatched work keeps going.

Session state persists on disk through auto-updates and supervisor restarts. Sessions are also preserved when your machine sleeps. Their processes resume on wake and the supervisor reconnects to them instead of treating the time gap as idle. Shutting down still stops running sessions; see [Sessions show as failed after shutdown](#sessions-show-as-failed-after-shutdown) for how to recover them.

### Row summaries

The one-line summary in each row is generated by a [Haiku-class model](/en/model-config) so the row can tell you what the session is doing, what it needs, or what it produced without opening the transcript. While a session is actively working, the summary refreshes at most once every 15 seconds, plus once when each turn ends.

From v2.1.161, when the session is running two or more parallel work items, such as subagents, background shell commands, or monitors, a `done/total` count such as `2/5` appears before the summary text.

Each refresh is one short Haiku-class request through your normal provider, billed and handled under the same [data usage terms](/en/data-usage) as the session itself. On third-party providers such as Bedrock, Vertex AI, Microsoft Foundry, and custom gateways, the request falls back to the session's main model when no Haiku model is configured. Set [`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`](/en/model-config#environment-variables) to choose the model for these summaries on those providers.

### Pull request status

When a session opens a pull request, a `PR #1234` label appears at the right edge of the row, linked to the pull request in terminals that support hyperlinks. The label persists when you send a follow-up to the session, so the pull request remains visible while the row reverts to live progress.

When a session has opened more than one pull request, the label shows a count instead, such as `3 PRs`, colored by the open pull request that most needs attention. Open the [peek panel](#peek-and-reply) to see them all.

The pull request number is colored by its status:

| Color  | Pull request status                           |
| :----- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Yellow | Waiting on checks or review, or checks failed |
| Green  | Checks passed and no review is blocking       |
| Purple | Merged                                        |
| Grey   | Draft or closed                               |

For most tasks this column is where you pick up the result: review and merge the pull request when its number turns green.

### Peek and reply

Press `Space` on a selected row to open the peek panel. It shows what the session needs from you, its most recent output, and any pull requests it opened. Most of the time this is enough, and you never need to open the full transcript.

From v2.1.161, when the session is running parallel work items, the panel also names the longest-running one and how long it has been going, so you can see what the session is waiting on without attaching.

Type a reply in the peek panel and press `Enter` to send it to that session. When the session is asking a multiple-choice question, the peek panel shows the options and you can press a number key to pick one. For other blocked sessions, press `Tab` to fill the input with a suggested reply you can edit before sending. Prefix a reply with `!` to send a Bash command instead.

From v2.1.145, with [voice dictation](/en/voice-dictation) enabled, hold or tap your push-to-talk key while the reply input is focused to dictate a reply instead of typing it. The same works in the dispatch input at the bottom of agent view.

Use `↑` and `↓` to peek at adjacent sessions without closing the panel, or `→` to attach.

### Attach to a session

Press `Enter` or `→` on a selected row to attach. Agent view is replaced by the full interactive session. When you attach, Claude posts a short recap of what happened while you were away.

While attached, the session behaves like any other Claude Code session: every [command](/en/commands), keyboard shortcut, and feature works.

Attached sessions always render in [fullscreen mode](/en/fullscreen), regardless of your `tui` setting, because a background session has no terminal scrollback to append to. Scroll with `PgUp`, `PgDn`, or the mouse wheel, and press `Ctrl+O` for transcript mode. Your terminal's native scroll and tmux copy mode show only the current viewport, the same as when you run any fullscreen application.

Press `←` on an empty prompt to detach and return to agent view. If a dialog has focus and isn't responding to `←`, press `Ctrl+Z` to detach immediately.

`Ctrl+C` keeps its standard interrupt behavior while attached: it cancels a running response or `!` shell command rather than detaching. Pressing `Ctrl+C` twice on an empty prompt detaches, the same as in any session.

Detaching never stops a background session: `←`, `Ctrl+Z`, `/exit`, and double `Ctrl+C` or double `Ctrl+D` all leave it running. To end a session from inside it, run `/stop`.

Pressing `←` on an empty prompt works from any Claude Code session, not only ones you attached to from agent view. It backgrounds the current session and opens agent view with that row selected, so you can switch sessions without leaving the terminal. The row is created even from a fresh session with no conversation history, so `→` returns to it. When that row is the only one, agent view shows an onboarding hint below it. You can turn this shortcut off in `/config` (the `leftArrowOpensAgents` setting).

### Organize the list

Agent view groups sessions so the ones that need input are at the top, with `Ready for review` and `Needs input` above `Working` and `Completed`. These group names don't map one-to-one to the [states](#read-session-state) above: a session moves to `Ready for review` when it has an open pull request, and `Completed` collects finished, failed, and stopped sessions together.

Press `Ctrl+S` to group by directory instead. Your choice persists across runs.

Within a group:

* Press `Ctrl+T` to pin a session to the top and [keep its process running](#the-supervisor-process) while idle
* Press `Shift+↑` or `Shift+↓` to reorder sessions
* Press `Ctrl+R` to rename a session
* Press `Enter` on a group header to collapse it

To remove a session from the list, press `Ctrl+X` to stop it and `Ctrl+X` again within two seconds to delete it. Pressing `Ctrl+X` on a group header deletes every session in that group after confirmation.

Deleting removes the session from agent view. If Claude [created a worktree](#how-file-edits-are-isolated) for the session, deleting removes that worktree too, including any uncommitted changes in it, so push or commit work you want to keep first. A worktree you created yourself and started the session inside is left in place. The conversation transcript stays on your local machine and remains available through `claude --resume`.

Older completed sessions fold into a `… N more` row to keep the list short. Failures and sessions with an open pull request always stay visible.

### Filter sessions

Type in the dispatch input to filter instead of dispatching:

| Filter                  | Shows                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a:<name>`              | Sessions running the named agent                                                                         |
| `s:<state>`             | Sessions in the given state, such as `s:working`. Also accepts `s:blocked` for everything waiting on you |
| `#<number>` or a PR URL | The session working on that pull request                                                                 |
| Any other URL           | The session whose first prompt contained that URL                                                        |

### Keyboard shortcuts

Press `?` in agent view to see every shortcut in context. The table below summarizes them.

| Shortcut              | Action                                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `↑` / `↓`             | Move between rows                                                                   |
| `Enter`               | Attach to the selected session, or dispatch if there's text in the input            |
| `Space`               | Open or close the peek panel for the selected session                               |
| `Shift+Enter`         | Dispatch and attach immediately                                                     |
| `→`                   | Attach to the selected session                                                      |
| `Alt+1`..`Alt+9`      | Attach to session 1–9 in the focused session's directory                            |
| `Tab`                 | On an empty input, browse all subagents. Otherwise apply the highlighted suggestion |
| `Ctrl+S`              | Switch grouping between state and directory                                         |
| `Ctrl+T`              | Pin or unpin the selected session                                                   |
| `Ctrl+R`              | Rename the selected session                                                         |
| `Ctrl+G`              | Open the dispatch prompt in your `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`                             |
| `Ctrl+X`              | Stop the session; press again within two seconds to delete it                       |
| `Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓` | Reorder the selected session                                                        |
| `Esc`                 | Close the peek panel, clear the input, or exit                                      |
| `Ctrl+C`              | Clear the input; press twice to exit                                                |
| `?`                   | Show all shortcuts                                                                  |

## Dispatch new agents

You can dispatch new background sessions from agent view, send an existing interactive session to the background, or start one directly from the shell.

### From agent view

Type a prompt in the input at the bottom of agent view and press `Enter` to start a new background session. The session is named automatically from the prompt; rename it later with `Ctrl+R`.

Paste an image into the prompt to include a screenshot or diagram with the task.

Prefix or mention parts of the prompt to control how the session starts:

| Input                             | Effect                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<agent-name> <prompt>`           | If the first word matches a custom [subagent](/en/sub-agents) name, that subagent runs as the session's main agent with the configuration from its frontmatter |
| `@<agent-name>`                   | Mention a custom subagent anywhere in the prompt to run it as the main agent                                                                                   |
| `@<repo>`                         | Mention a repository under the directory you opened agent view from to run the session there                                                                   |
| `/<command>`                      | Suggest [skills](/en/skills) and [commands](/en/commands) to dispatch as the prompt                                                                            |
| `! <command>`                     | Run a shell command as a background job instead of starting a Claude session. The job appears as a row you can attach to, watch, and detach from               |
| `#<number>` or a pull request URL | If a session is already working on that PR, select it instead of dispatching                                                                                   |
| `Shift+Enter`                     | Dispatch and immediately attach to the new session                                                                                                             |

A small set of commands run in agent view itself instead of dispatching: `/exit` and `/quit` close agent view, `/logout` signs you out, and `/model` sets the [dispatch model](#set-the-model). Skills, your own commands, and prompt-expanding built-ins such as `/init` are sent to a new background session as their first prompt. Other built-in commands show an `attach to a session to run it` hint instead.

Packaging a recurring task as a [skill](/en/skills) lets you start the same workflow from agent view repeatedly without retyping the prompt.

When the same `@name` matches both a subagent and a sibling repository, the subagent takes precedence. The bare first-word match also applies, so a prompt that happens to begin with one of your subagent names dispatches that subagent rather than treating the word as plain text. Use the `@` form when you want to be explicit, or start the prompt with a different word to avoid the match.

#### Dispatch to a specific directory

A new session runs in the directory you opened agent view from. To target a different directory:

* Open `claude agents` in that directory.
* Open `claude agents` in a parent directory that holds several repositories and mention one with `@<repo>` in the prompt to run the session there.
* From the shell, `cd` into the directory and run `claude --bg "<prompt>"`.

When agent view is grouped by directory, the highlighted row's directory becomes the dispatch target, so you can scroll to a group and dispatch into it without retyping the path.

### From inside a session

Run `/background` or its alias `/bg` to move the current conversation into a background session. Pass a prompt such as `/bg run the test suite and fix any failures` to give one more instruction first. If Claude is responding when you run `/bg`, the response continues in the background session.

Backgrounding from an interactive session starts a fresh process that resumes from the saved conversation, so running subagents, [monitors](/en/tools-reference#monitor-tool), and background commands do not transfer to it. Claude asks you to confirm before backgrounding when any are running. Once in the background, the session can start new subagents, monitors, and background commands, and those keep running across later detach and reattach.

Configuration flags from the original launch carry through to the backgrounded session, so its MCP servers, settings, and fallback model remain in effect:

* `--mcp-config` and `--strict-mcp-config`
* `--settings`
* `--add-dir`
* `--plugin-dir`
* `--fallback-model`
* `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`

Directories you added during the session with [`/add-dir`](/en/permissions#additional-directories-grant-file-access-not-configuration) also carry through.

Carrying `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` through keeps `bypassPermissions` reachable in the backgrounded session, but it doesn't grant anything new. The mode still requires the same one-time interactive acceptance described in [Permission mode, model, and effort](#permission-mode-model-and-effort) before any session can use it.

### From your shell

Pass `--bg` or its long form `--background` to start a session that goes straight to the background:

```bash theme={null}
claude --bg "investigate the flaky SettingsChangeDetector test"
```

To run a specific subagent as the session's main agent, combine `--bg` with `--agent`:

```bash theme={null}
claude --agent code-reviewer --bg "address review comments on PR 1234"
```

Pass `--name` to set the session's display name in agent view instead of the auto-generated one:

```bash theme={null}
claude --bg --name "flaky-test-fix" "investigate the flaky SettingsChangeDetector test"
```

After backgrounding, Claude prints the session's short ID and the commands for managing it. When you pass `--name`, the name appears after the short ID:

```text theme={null}
backgrounded · 7c5dcf5d · flaky-test-fix
  claude agents             list sessions
  claude attach 7c5dcf5d    open in this terminal
  claude logs 7c5dcf5d      show recent output
  claude stop 7c5dcf5d      stop this session
```

#### Run a shell command

To run a shell command as a background job instead of a Claude session, type `!` as the first character of the agent view dispatch input. The `!` shows as a prefix and everything you type after it is the command. The following example dispatches `pytest -x` from the agent view input box:

```text theme={null}
! pytest -x
```

Press `Enter` to start the job. The same job can also be launched directly from your shell with `--exec`:

```bash theme={null}
claude --bg --exec 'pytest -x'
```

The command runs as a PTY-backed job and appears as a row in agent view, with the most recent line of output as its status. A shell job runs the command in place of Claude, so no model is invoked and the output isn't sent to any session.

To see the output, attach to the row, press `Space` to peek without attaching, or run `claude logs <id>` from your shell. The captured output stays in memory and isn't written to disk. The row and its output clean up automatically about five minutes after the command exits, so read it before then if you need the result.

### How file edits are isolated

Every background session, whether started from agent view, `/bg`, or `claude --bg`, starts in your working directory. Before editing files, Claude moves the session into an isolated [git worktree](/en/worktrees) under `.claude/worktrees/`, so parallel sessions can read the same checkout but each writes to its own.

Claude skips the worktree when:

* The session is already inside a linked git worktree, whether Claude created it under `.claude/worktrees/` or you created it with `git worktree add` somewhere else
* The working directory isn't a git repository and no [`WorktreeCreate` hook](/en/hooks#worktreecreate) is configured
* The write is outside the working directory

To turn off worktree isolation for a repository where git worktrees are impractical, set [`worktree.bgIsolation`](/en/settings#worktree-settings) to `"none"`. Background sessions then edit your working copy directly without moving into a worktree first. Add the setting to the project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "worktree": {
    "bgIsolation": "none"
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The `worktree.bgIsolation` setting requires Claude Code v2.1.143 or later.
</Note>

Outside a git repository, sessions write to the working directory directly and aren't isolated from each other, so avoid dispatching parallel sessions that edit the same files. If you use a different version control system, configure a [`WorktreeCreate` hook](/en/worktrees#non-git-version-control) and Claude isolates edits the same way it does for git.

Deleting a session in agent view with `Ctrl+X` twice removes a worktree Claude created for it, including any uncommitted changes, so merge or push the changes you want to keep first. Deleting from the shell with [`claude rm`](#manage-sessions-from-the-shell) keeps a worktree that has uncommitted changes and prints its path so you can clean it up yourself. A worktree you created yourself and started the session inside is left in place either way.

To find a session's worktree path, peek the session or attach and check its working directory.

A [subagent](/en/sub-agents) the background session spawns inherits the session's working directory, so its file edits land in the session's worktree rather than your working copy. To give a subagent its own separate worktree instead, set [`isolation: worktree`](/en/sub-agents#supported-frontmatter-fields) in its frontmatter or pass `isolation: "worktree"` when spawning it.

### Set the model

The model name shown in the agent view header is the dispatch default. New sessions you start from the input use this model, which comes from the [`model` setting](/en/settings#available-settings) in your user settings. Set it by selecting a model in the [`/model` picker](/en/model-config), or edit the setting directly.

To override the dispatch default for the whole agent view session, pass `--model` when opening agent view. See [Permission mode, model, and effort](#permission-mode-model-and-effort).

To change the dispatch default from inside agent view, type `/model` followed by a model name in the dispatch input and press `Enter`. The header updates to show that model with a `(session)` marker, and sessions you dispatch afterward use it. Type `/model default` to clear the override and return to the dispatch default. This override lasts for the rest of the current `claude agents` run, doesn't write to your settings file, and requires Claude Code v2.1.172 or later. {/* min-version: 2.1.172 */} The following example dispatches one session on Opus and the next on Sonnet:

```text theme={null}
/model opus
refactor auth
/model sonnet
run the test suite
```

Each background session can run on a different model. To override it for one session:

* From the shell, pass `--model` with `claude --bg`.
* Attach to a running session, open `/model`, and press `s` on a model to switch for that session only. The change persists if the session is respawned.
* Dispatch a [subagent](/en/sub-agents) whose frontmatter sets a `model` field.

### Permission mode, model, and effort

A background session reads its [settings](/en/settings) from the directory it runs in, the same as if you had started `claude` there. This includes [`env` values](/en/settings#available-settings) in project settings, so an `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or provider variable set there applies to background sessions in that directory.

Cloud provider selection, such as `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` or `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` aliases follow the shell that dispatched the session. Gateway endpoint variables such as `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and its paired `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` don't. See [the supervisor process](#the-supervisor-process) for how background sessions source provider settings and credentials.

The [permission mode](/en/permissions) depends on how you started the session. Backgrounding an existing session with `/bg` or `←` keeps the current permission mode, so a session you switched to `acceptEdits` or `auto` stays in that mode after detaching. Dispatching from the agent view input or running `claude --bg` from your shell uses the `defaultMode` from that directory's settings, or the `permissionMode` from the dispatched [subagent's frontmatter](/en/sub-agents#supported-frontmatter-fields).

The permission mode, model, and effort a background session was started with, along with the [configuration flags it carries](#from-inside-a-session), all persist when the supervisor later [stops and restarts](#the-supervisor-process) its process. A session you launched with `claude --bg --dangerously-skip-permissions` or `claude --bg --permission-mode bypassPermissions` stays in `bypassPermissions` after that restart instead of falling back to the directory's `defaultMode`, and a model or effort you changed mid-session with `/model` or `/effort` is kept.

To set defaults for every session you dispatch from agent view, pass any of `--permission-mode`, `--model`, `--effort`, or `--agent` when opening it:

```bash theme={null}
claude agents --permission-mode plan --model opus --effort high
```

`--agent` sets the [subagent](/en/sub-agents) used when a dispatch prompt doesn't name one, either with `@name` or as the first word. It defaults to the [`agent` setting](/en/settings#available-settings) if one is set, otherwise the built-in catch-all `claude` agent. Naming a subagent in the dispatch input overrides both.

`claude agents` also accepts `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as shorthand for `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, and `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions` to make `bypassPermissions` available in each dispatched session's `Shift+Tab` cycle without starting in that mode. Both match the [top-level CLI flags](/en/cli-reference).

These flags were added across releases. Earlier versions reject them with an unknown-option error.

| Flag or setting                                                              | Minimum version                       |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `--permission-mode`, `--model`, `--effort`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | v2.1.142 {/* min-version: 2.1.142 */} |
| `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`                                       | v2.1.143 {/* min-version: 2.1.143 */} |
| `--agent`, and honoring the `agent` setting for dispatched sessions          | v2.1.157 {/* min-version: 2.1.157 */} |

Before v2.1.157, agent view ignores the `agent` setting and dispatches the built-in `claude` agent.

The active defaults appear in the footer below the dispatch input.

Without these flags, the session uses the `defaultMode` from that directory's settings or the `permissionMode` from the dispatched [subagent's frontmatter](/en/sub-agents#supported-frontmatter-fields), and the model shown in the agent view header.

Using `bypassPermissions` or `auto` is refused until you have accepted that mode by running `claude` with it once interactively, since those modes let a session you aren't watching act without approval. The same applies whether you pass the mode to `claude agents` or to `claude --bg --permission-mode`.

### Settings, plugins, and MCP servers

Agent view accepts the same configuration flags as `claude` for loading settings, plugins, MCP servers, and additional directories. These flags require Claude Code v2.1.142 or later. Each flag applies to agent view itself and is passed through to every session you dispatch from it, so a plugin or MCP server you load this way is available in those sessions too.

| Flag                                                                                             | Effect                                                                         |

Repeat `--add-dir`, `--plugin-dir`, or `--mcp-config` once per value. The space-separated form, such as `--add-dir a b c`, isn't supported with `claude agents`.

The following example opens agent view with a settings override and one extra directory:

```bash theme={null}
claude agents --settings ./ci-settings.json --add-dir ../shared-lib
```

## Manage sessions from the shell

Every background session has a short ID you can use from the shell. The ID is printed when you start a session with `claude --bg`, and each session's ID is its directory name under `~/.claude/jobs/`. These commands are useful for scripting or when you don't want to open agent view.

| Command                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## How background sessions are hosted

Every session listed in agent view is considered a background session, whether or not you're currently attached to it. By contrast, a session started by running `claude` directly is tied to that terminal and ends when it closes, unless you [send it to the background](#from-inside-a-session).

### The supervisor process

Background sessions are hosted by a per-user supervisor process, separate from your terminal and from agent view. The supervisor starts automatically the first time you background a session or open agent view, and you don't manage it directly.

The supervisor keeps one pre-warmed worker process ready so a dispatch from agent view or `claude --bg` starts without the delay of a cold launch. When you dispatch, the supervisor assigns the pre-warmed worker to your session, applies that session's directory, settings, and credentials to it, and then starts a replacement for the next dispatch. If no healthy pre-warmed worker is available, the supervisor launches a fresh process instead.

The supervisor and its sessions authenticate with the same stored credentials as your interactive sessions and make no additional network connections beyond the model API. Provider selection variables such as `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` aliases are read from the shell that dispatched each session and are applied to its worker.

{/* min-version: 2.1.174 */}A background session doesn't inherit gateway endpoint variables such as `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, the equivalent Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry base URL variables, or a paired `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` from the shell that started the supervisor or from the dispatching shell. The session uses your stored credentials and any `env` values in the project directory's [settings](/en/settings) instead. To point background sessions in a project at an [LLM gateway](/en/llm-gateway), set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in that project's `.claude/settings.json` `env` block rather than exporting it in your shell. Before v2.1.174, a background session inherited these variables from the supervisor's launch shell, so it could use the gateway you had configured in that shell instead of the one configured for the project directory.

Each background session is its own Claude Code process, managed by the supervisor rather than tied to your terminal. A session that's actively working, waiting for your input, or has a terminal attached keeps its process running. A running background shell command, subagent, dynamic workflow, or monitor counts as active work, so a long-running process such as a dev server keeps the session alive.

Once a session finishes and sits unattached for about an hour, the supervisor stops its process to free resources. A session you have [pinned](#organize-the-list) with `Ctrl+T` is exempt and keeps its process running while idle. The transcript and state stay on disk either way, and the next time you attach, peek, or reply to a stopped session, the supervisor starts a fresh process from where it left off. When every session has finished and no terminal is connected, the supervisor itself exits and starts again the next time you need it.

An empty row left over from pressing `←` that was never given a prompt is removed entirely after about five minutes so the list clears on its own. Sessions started with `claude --bg` and sessions waiting on a setup prompt such as a trust dialog aren't removed this way.

When the host runs low on memory, the supervisor stops idle non-pinned sessions first and stops idle pinned ones only if that freed nothing.

The supervisor watches the installed Claude Code binary on disk and restarts into the new version after the regular [auto-updater](/en/setup#auto-updates) replaces it. This is a local file watch, not a network check. Background sessions are detached processes, so they keep running through the restart and the new supervisor reconnects to them. An idle pinned session is also restarted in place onto the new version so it picks up the update without you reattaching.

### Where state is stored

Session state is stored under your Claude Code config directory. If you set [`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`](/en/env-vars), the supervisor uses that directory instead of `~/.claude` and runs as a separate instance with its own sessions.

| Path                             | Contents                                                                                                    |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.claude/daemon.log`           | Supervisor log                                                                                              |
| `~/.claude/daemon/roster.json`   | List of running background sessions, used to reconnect after a restart                                      |
| `~/.claude/jobs/<id>/state.json` | Per-session state shown in agent view                                                                       |
| `~/.claude/jobs/<id>/tmp/`       | Per-session scratch directory. Writes here don't prompt for permission. Removed when the session is deleted |

Each background session has the `CLAUDE_JOB_DIR` environment variable set to its `~/.claude/jobs/<id>` directory, so shell commands the session runs can write temporary files to `$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR/tmp` without colliding with parallel sessions.

To inspect this state without reading the files directly, run `claude daemon status`. It reports whether the supervisor is reachable, its process ID and version, the socket directory, and how many background sessions are live. `/doctor` includes a summary of the same check.

The command also warns when the running supervisor is on a different version than the `claude` you invoked, which happens after an update the supervisor hasn't restarted into yet. The warning shows both versions and tells you to run `claude daemon stop --any` to pick up the new version. When Claude Code is installed as an OS service, the suggested command is `claude daemon stop` without the flag.

On Windows, `claude daemon status` surfaces the underlying file error when the daemon's pipe-key file is locked or unreadable instead of reporting a generic connection failure.

### Turn off agent view

To turn off background agents and agent view entirely, set the `disableAgentView` [setting](/en/settings) to `true` or set the `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AGENT_VIEW` environment variable. Administrators can enforce this through [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings).

## Troubleshooting

### `claude agents` lists subagents instead of opening agent view

If `claude agents` prints a count followed by your configured subagents and then exits, agent view is unavailable in your environment. Earlier versions didn't open agent view in every environment, including when connected through Bedrock, Vertex AI, or Foundry. Run `claude update` to install the latest version.

If agent view still doesn't open after updating, check whether it has been [turned off](#turn-off-agent-view) by a setting or environment variable.

### Agent view opens with no sessions

Before you dispatch your first session, agent view shows a short onboarding hint with example prompts in place of the session list. Type a prompt in the input at the bottom and press `Enter` to dispatch your first session.

### Cannot open agents because work is running in the background

If pressing `←` to background the current session shows `Cannot open agents — N still running in the background`, the session has in-flight work such as a subagent, a dynamic workflow, or a background shell command, and the shortcut won't silently abandon it. Run `/tasks` to see what's running, then `/bg` to confirm abandoning them. See [From inside a session](#from-inside-a-session) for what does and doesn't transfer when you background.

### Prompt rejected as too short

The dispatch input expects a task description, not a conversational opener. A prompt shorter than four characters is rejected with a `Too short` hint so a stray keystroke doesn't start a session. Describe what you want the session to do, such as `investigate the flaky checkout test`.

### Sessions show as failed after shutdown

Shutting down or restarting your machine stops running background sessions, so they show as failed when you next open agent view. Attach, peek, or reply to any of them and the session restarts from where it left off.

Sleep alone doesn't cause this. Sessions are preserved across sleep and the supervisor reconnects to them on wake.

### Agent view says the background service did not respond

If attaching, peeking, or `claude logs` reports that the background service did not respond, the supervisor process has likely stalled. Stop it and let the next `claude agents` start a fresh one. To keep your background sessions running through the restart, pass `--keep-workers`:

```bash theme={null}
claude daemon stop --any --keep-workers
```

The new supervisor reconnects to the running sessions. Without `--keep-workers`, the command ends the background sessions too. The `--any` flag confirms you want to stop a supervisor that started on demand rather than as an installed service, which is the default.

On Windows, if the supervisor doesn't respond to the stop request, the command prints its process ID. End that process with `taskkill /PID <pid>` to finish the recovery. Background sessions are still preserved when you passed `--keep-workers`.

### Dispatch fails with `Could not resolve authentication method`

{/* min-version: 2.1.174 */}If a background dispatch fails with `Could not resolve authentication method` while interactive sessions authenticate normally, the worker that received the dispatch did not pick up credentials. On v2.1.174 and later the supervisor supplies a fresh credential snapshot when it assigns a [pre-warmed worker](#the-supervisor-process), so this error means no stored credential was available to the supervisor process itself. Confirm you have run `/login` or configured an API key, then stop the supervisor:

```bash theme={null}
claude daemon stop --any --keep-workers
```

The next `claude agents` or `claude --bg` starts a fresh supervisor that reads your stored credentials. If you authenticate with an environment variable such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` rather than `/login`, run that next command from a shell where the variable is set.

See the [error reference](/en/errors#could-not-resolve-authentication-method) for the full list of causes and fixes. Before v2.1.174, a pre-warmed worker that sat idle could surface this error when it was assigned to a dispatch even when your credentials were valid. Upgrade to recover.

### Background sessions cannot read Desktop, Documents, or Downloads on macOS

On macOS, the background session host runs as its own process and requests access to protected folders separately from your terminal. If a background session reports `Operation not permitted` when reading `~/Desktop`, `~/Documents`, `~/Downloads`, or another protected location, grant access in System Settings under Privacy & Security > Files and Folders, or enable Full Disk Access for the entry.

With the native installer, the entry appears as Claude Code and the grant persists across updates. With other install methods such as Homebrew or npm, the entry shows the binary path and may need to be granted again after updating.

### A session is slow to respond after attaching

Once a session has finished and sat unattached for about an hour, the supervisor stops its process to free resources. Attaching starts a fresh process from where it left off, which takes a moment. Sessions that are working, waiting on you, or [pinned](#organize-the-list) are not stopped this way, so pin a session with `Ctrl+T` to keep it responsive.

### `.claude/worktrees/` is filling up

Deleting a session in agent view removes the worktree Claude created for it. `claude rm` keeps a worktree that has uncommitted changes and prints its path. List leftover entries with `git worktree list` in the project directory and remove each with `git worktree remove <path>`. See [Clean up worktrees](/en/worktrees#clean-up-worktrees).

## Limitations

Agent view is in research preview with the following limitations:

* **Rate limits apply**: background sessions consume your subscription usage the same as interactive sessions, so running ten agents in parallel uses quota roughly ten times as fast as running one.
* **Sessions are local**: background sessions run on your machine. They are preserved across sleep but stop if the machine shuts down.
* **Claude-created worktrees are deleted with the session in agent view**: merge or push changes before deleting a session that edited files in its own worktree. `claude rm` keeps a worktree that has uncommitted changes; a worktree you created yourself is left in place.
