# Model configuration

> Configure which model Claude Code uses, effort levels, extended context, and the auto-compact window

## Available models

For the `model` setting in Claude Code, you can configure either:

* A **model alias**
* A **model name**
  * Anthropic API: a full **[model name](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview)**
  * Amazon Bedrock: an inference profile ARN
  * Microsoft Foundry: a deployment name
  * Google Cloud's Agent Platform: a version name

For guidance on which model and effort level fit different kinds of work, see [Choosing a Claude model and effort level in Claude Code](https://claude.com/blog/claude-model-and-effort-level-in-claude-code) on the blog.

<Note>
  `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` changes where requests are sent, not which model answers them. To route Claude through an LLM gateway, see [LLM gateways](/docs/en/llm-gateway).

### Model aliases

Use a model alias to select model settings without remembering exact version numbers:

| Model alias      | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`default`**    | Special value that clears any model override and reverts to the [runtime default for your account](#default-model-setting). Not itself a model alias                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`best`**       | Uses the latest Fable model where it's available to you, otherwise the same model as `opus`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **`fable`**      | Uses the latest Fable model for your hardest and longest-running tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`sonnet`**     | Uses the latest Sonnet model for daily coding tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **`opus`**       | Uses the latest Opus model for complex reasoning tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`haiku`**      | Uses the fast and efficient Haiku model for simple tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`sonnet[1m]`** | Uses Sonnet with a [1 million token context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#context-window-sizes-by-model) for long sessions. No effect when `sonnet` already resolves to Sonnet 5 with its native 1M window; behind an [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway), selects the 1M window for Sonnet 5 |
| **`opus[1m]`**   | Uses Opus with a [1 million token context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#context-window-sizes-by-model) for long sessions                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`opusplan`**   | Special mode that uses `opus` during plan mode, then switches to `sonnet` for execution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The version that the `opus` and `sonnet` aliases resolve to depends on the provider:

| Provider                                             | `opus`   | `sonnet`   |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------- |
| Anthropic API                                        | Opus 5   | Sonnet 5   |
| [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/claude-platform-on-aws) | Opus 5   | Sonnet 4.6 |
| Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform        | Opus 5   | Sonnet 4.5 |
| Microsoft Foundry                                    | Opus 4.6 | Sonnet 4.5 |

Unless you set `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`, the `fable` alias resolves to Fable 5.1. Before v2.1.255, it resolved to Fable 5.

Where an alias resolves to an older model, newer models are available by selecting the full model name explicitly or setting `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`.

Before v2.1.219, `opus` resolved to Opus 4.8 on the Anthropic API from v2.1.154, and on Claude Platform on AWS, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Agent Platform from v2.1.207. Before v2.1.207, `opus` resolved to Opus 4.7 on Claude Platform on AWS and to Opus 4.6 on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud's Agent Platform.

Aliases point to the recommended version for your provider and update over time. To pin to a specific version, use the full model name, for example `claude-opus-5`, or set the corresponding environment variable like `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`.

<Note>
  Opus 5 requires Claude Code v2.1.219 or later. Sonnet 5 requires v2.1.197 or later. Opus 4.8 requires v2.1.154 or later. Run `claude update` to upgrade.
</Note>

### Work with Fable

[Claude Fable 5.1](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) and Claude Fable 5 are the most capable models in Claude Code, suited to tasks larger than a single sitting. They sustain long autonomous sessions, investigate before acting, and verify their work more often than smaller models. Fable 5.1 is the newer release.

Neither Fable model is the account-type default on any plan or provider. Select one explicitly:

* **Fable 5.1**: run `/model fable`, or launch with `claude --model fable`.
* **Fable 5**: select it by model ID. On the Anthropic API, run `/model claude-fable-5` or launch with `claude --model claude-fable-5`. On other providers, use your provider's Fable 5 model ID or [pin it](#pin-models-for-third-party-deployments) with `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`.

If your user settings hold `claude-fable-5` or `claude-fable-5[1m]` as the model, for example because you selected Fable in the `/model` picker before v2.1.255, and you connect to the Anthropic API directly, Claude Code changes that saved value to the `fable` or `fable[1m]` alias the first time you run v2.1.255 or later, and the startup model line shows `(auto-updated)` once. A `claude-fable-5` value in project, local, or managed settings is left as it is.

Requests that a Fable model's safety classifiers flag, most often in cybersecurity and biology domains, trigger [automatic model fallback](#automatic-model-fallback).

To get the most from Fable:

* **Describe the outcome, not the steps**: hand it the result you want and let it plan the path. To keep it working toward that outcome, [set a goal](/docs/en/goal).
* **Hand it ambiguous problems**: root-cause investigations, outage debugging, and architecture decisions are where the extra investigation and verification pay off.
* **Skip the verification reminders**: it verifies its own work with less prompting, so reminders to test or check are usually unnecessary.
* **Size up larger tasks**: give it work you would normally break into pieces. It holds long sessions without losing the thread.

<Note>
  Fable 5.1 requires Claude Code v2.1.255 or later. If a request for it from an older version fails, see [Claude Code does not support this model](/docs/en/errors#claude-code-does-not-support-this-model). Fable 5 requires v2.1.170 or later. Run `claude update` to upgrade. For availability under zero data retention, see [Model availability under ZDR](/docs/en/zero-data-retention#model-availability-under-zdr).
</Note>

On the Anthropic API, the `/model` picker lists a Fable model only after the server reports it available for your organization. When you type `/model fable` or a Fable model ID, Claude Code checks availability with the server directly, so the selection can succeed before the picker lists the entry.

#### Fable and usage credits

Depending on your plan and seat tier, Fable usage can bill to [usage credits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12429409-extra-usage-for-paid-claude-plans) instead of drawing on your plan's included limits. When it does, the `/model` picker shows "Requires usage credits" on the Fable row. To manage usage credits, see [Add usage credits to your subscription](/docs/en/costs#add-usage-credits-to-your-subscription).

In interactive sessions, Claude Code shows a consent prompt before a Fable request bills usage credits. Members of Enterprise plans with organization billing don't see the prompt. You can continue on Fable using usage credits or switch to your default model. You can also dismiss the prompt:

* In the `/model` picker, you keep your current model.
* Mid-session, Claude Code continues the turn on your default model.

After you choose to continue on Fable using usage credits, Claude Code doesn't show the prompt again.

In a session with [Remote Control](/docs/en/remote-control) connected, a [background session](/docs/en/agent-view), or an [agent team](/docs/en/agent-teams) teammate's session, nobody may be at the terminal, so Claude Code holds the mid-session consent prompt for the [`dialogExpiry`](/docs/en/settings-reference#dialogexpiry) deadline, five minutes by default. If nobody has answered by the deadline, Claude Code ends the turn without sending the request and adds a notice to the transcript, which the Remote Control client also shows. Your model selection is unchanged, and Claude Code asks for consent again on your next message.

What you can do while the prompt is waiting depends on the session:

* With Remote Control connected or in a teammate's session, press any key at the terminal to cancel the deadline, and Claude Code waits for your answer.
* In a background session, answer before the deadline.
* If you send a new message from the remote client before anyone has typed at the terminal, Claude Code ends the turn the same way, and your new message starts the next turn. After someone types at the terminal, Claude Code keeps waiting for the answer and queues your new message behind it.

In [non-interactive mode](/docs/en/headless) with the `-p` flag and through the Agent SDK, Claude Code never shows the consent prompt. When a Fable request there would bill to usage credits, Claude Code bills it without asking.

### Setting your model

You can configure your model in several ways, listed in order of priority:

1. **During session**: use `/model <alias|name>` to switch immediately, or run `/model` with no argument to open the picker. See [when Claude Code asks you to confirm the switch](/docs/en/prompt-caching#switching-models)
2. **At startup**: launch with `claude --model <alias|name>`
3. **Environment variable**: set `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=<alias|name>`
4. **Settings**: configure permanently in your settings file using the `model` field
5. **[Default for new sessions](#set-a-default-model-for-new-sessions)**: set `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL=<alias|name>`

`/model` saves your choice as the default for new sessions by writing the `model` field in your user settings. In the picker:

* `Enter`: switch model and save as your default
* `s`: switch model for this session only

Typing `/model <name>` directly behaves like `Enter`. A model set with `/model` in [non-interactive mode](/docs/en/headless), with the `-p` flag, applies to the current session only and isn't saved as your default. Project and managed settings still take precedence and reapply on the next launch. An [organization default model](#organization-default-model) that your admin has configured to override user selection also reapplies on the next launch.

In v2.1.144 through v2.1.152, `/model` applied to the current session only and `d` in the picker saved a default.

The `--model` flag and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable apply only to the session you launch with them. To run different models in different terminals at the same time, launch each one with its own `--model` flag rather than switching with `/model`.

Prices in the `/model` picker appear when Claude Code talks to the Anthropic API, directly or through an [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway) that proxies it, and the price on a row is the price of the model that row selects. On [third-party providers](/docs/en/third-party-integrations) such as Amazon Bedrock and on the [Claude apps gateway](/docs/en/claude-apps-gateway), your provider or gateway determines what you pay, so picker rows show no price. The price is a display label only; it doesn't affect which model a row selects or what your provider bills. Before v2.1.206, [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/claude-platform-on-aws) and gateway sessions showed Anthropic list prices, and a row could show the price of a different model than the one it selected.

Resumed sessions started with `claude --resume`, `--continue`, or the `/resume` picker keep the model they were using when the transcript was saved, regardless of the current `model` setting. If the restored model has been retired or is excluded by [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection), the session falls through to the normal precedence order. This prevents another session's `/model` choice from changing the model on resume. On providers that use provider-specific deployment IDs rather than Anthropic model IDs, such as Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry, the transcript model isn't restored at all and the session resolves its model through the normal precedence order.

A model you pick for the new launch with `--model` or `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` still takes precedence over the restored model. As of v2.1.195, so does an [`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`](#environment-variables) family variable. [`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL`](#set-a-default-model-for-new-sessions) can too, under the conditions listed in its section.

When the active model at startup comes from project or managed settings rather than your own selection, the startup header shows which settings file set it. Run `/model` to override; the project or managed setting reapplies on the next launch. On platforms that embed Claude Code and set [`CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST`](/docs/en/env-vars), the host's model configuration takes precedence over managed model settings, while a managed `availableModels` allowlist stays in force unless the host supplies its own; [Exceptions to managed settings precedence](/docs/en/settings#exceptions-to-managed-settings-precedence) says which keys and variables the host overrides.

When a model switch is requested through the [Agent SDK](/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) `setModel()` method or by an app such as the [Desktop app](/docs/en/desktop) that runs the Claude Code CLI for you, Claude Code checks that the string is one it recognizes before saving it. This check requires Claude Code v2.1.200 or later. On the Anthropic API, Claude Code recognizes:

* a model alias
* an entry from the `/model` picker
* any name that starts with `claude-`
* a value you configured yourself as a [custom model option](#add-a-custom-model-option) or in [`modelOverrides`](#override-model-ids-per-version)

Claude Code rejects an unrecognized string with `Model "<name>" is not a recognized model id.` and the session keeps its current model, instead of saving the string and failing on the next request. See [the error reference](/docs/en/errors#model-is-not-a-recognized-model-id) for recovery steps.

The check runs only on the Anthropic API. On Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, Microsoft Foundry, [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/claude-platform-on-aws), and behind an [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway) or a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, your provider or gateway defines the model names, so Claude Code passes any string through without checking it. The check also doesn't cover the `--model` flag, the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable, or the `model` setting; a mistyped value there produces [There's an issue with the selected model](/docs/en/errors#theres-an-issue-with-the-selected-model) on the first request instead. Claude Code can still write the [unrecognized-model diagnostic line](/docs/en/errors#unrecognized-model-id-on-a-request) at request time, on every provider.

When the requested model has a scheduled retirement date or is automatically remapped to a newer version, Claude Code shows a warning that names the requested model. Interactive sessions show it as a startup notice. From v2.1.182, the same warning is written to stderr in [non-interactive mode](/docs/en/headless) when using the default text output format. The check also covers a `model` set in [subagent frontmatter](/docs/en/sub-agents). The stderr warning is suppressed for `--output-format json` and `stream-json`; read the actual model from the `modelUsage` field of the [result message](/docs/en/headless#get-structured-output) instead.

For example, start a session on Opus:

```bash theme={null}
claude --model opus
```

Then switch models from within the session:

```text theme={null}
/model sonnet
```

Example settings file:

```json theme={null}
{
    "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Bash(npm run lint)"]
    },
    "model": "opus"
}
```

#### Set a default model for new sessions

Set `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL=<alias|name>` to choose the model your sessions start on by default. Requires Claude Code v2.1.236 or later.

Claude Code starts a new session on the variable's model only when none of these selects a model:

* The `--model` flag
* `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`
* A `model` value in any settings file, including the choice you save with `/model`
* An [organization default model](#organization-default-model)

A choice you save with `/model` takes precedence over the variable on later launches too. With `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` set instead, Claude Code returns to that variable's model on the next launch, whatever you saved with `/model`.

Claude Code also resolves the Default option to the variable's model, unless an organization default model applies. When the Default option resolves to the variable's model, the Default row in the `/model` picker shows the label Set by ANTHROPIC\_DEFAULT\_MODEL.

Claude Code ignores the variable in these cases, and the Default option resolves as if you hadn't set it:

* You set it to `default`, `inherit`, `opusplan`, or `haiku`
* [`enforceAvailableModels`](#enforce-the-allowlist-for-the-default-model) is on
* [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection) or [organization model restrictions](#organization-model-restrictions) exclude the model
* The model isn't available to your account

When a new session would start on the variable's model, a session you resume with `claude --resume`, `--continue`, or the `/resume` picker starts on it too. Claude Code doesn't restore the model saved in that session's transcript. Otherwise Claude Code doesn't use the variable when you [resume a session](#setting-your-model).

## Restrict model selection

Enterprise administrators can use `availableModels` in [managed or policy settings](/docs/en/managed-settings) to restrict which models users can select. Entries match a model family such as `sonnet`, a version prefix such as `claude-sonnet-4-5`, or a full model ID such as `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`. A version prefix also matches later model IDs that extend it with another segment, so `claude-fable-5` permits both Fable 5 and Fable 5.1, while `claude-fable-5-1` permits Fable 5.1 only.

On platforms that embed Claude Code and set [`CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST`](/docs/en/env-vars), the host's model configuration takes precedence over managed model settings, while a managed `availableModels` allowlist stays in force unless the host supplies its own; [Exceptions to managed settings precedence](/docs/en/settings#exceptions-to-managed-settings-precedence) says which keys and variables the host overrides.

When `availableModels` is set, the allowlist applies everywhere a user can specify a model:

* **Main session model**: `/model`, the `--model` flag, the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable, the `model` setting, [`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL`](#set-a-default-model-for-new-sessions), and the model restored when [resuming a session](#setting-your-model)
* **Alias resolution**: the `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` environment variables cannot redirect an allowed alias to a model outside the list
* **Fast mode**: `/fast` refuses to toggle when it would implicitly switch to an Opus model outside the list, with the message "is not in your organization's allowed models"
* **Subagent and teammate models**: the `model` field in [subagent](/docs/en/sub-agents#choose-a-model) frontmatter, the Agent tool's `model` parameter, [agent team](/docs/en/agent-teams#specify-teammates-and-models) teammate models, `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`, and, on v2.1.197 and earlier, the model picker in the `/agents` wizard&#x20;
* **Skill and command models**: the `model` frontmatter in [skills and commands](/docs/en/skills)
* **Advisor model**: the configured [`advisorModel`](/docs/en/advisor) setting and the `--advisor` flag
* **Background agent model**: the model selected in the [dispatch picker](/docs/en/agent-view)

On the Anthropic API and [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/claude-platform-on-aws), a model family alias, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, or `fable`, resolves to its usual model when the allowlist permits that model. When the allowlist blocks that model, Claude Code substitutes the newest version of the family that the allowlist permits and shows a notice naming both the requested and substituted models. With `["sonnet", "claude-opus-4-6"]`, for example, both `/model opus` and `--model opus` select Claude Opus 4.6, the newest permitted Opus. Before v2.1.205, an alias whose newest released version was outside the list was rejected or replaced like any other blocked selection, even when the list permitted an older version.

The substitution needs a permitted version to land on: when the allowlist permits no version of the alias's family, the alias follows the rejection and replacement behavior below like any other blocked value.

Claude Code handles any other blocked selection according to where the model was set:

* **`/model`**: Claude Code rejects the switch with an error
* **`--model` flag, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, or the `model` setting**: Claude Code replaces the value at startup with a warning naming both the requested and substituted models, and the session starts on the default model
* **[`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL`](#set-a-default-model-for-new-sessions)**: Claude Code ignores the variable
* **Subagent or teammate override**: Claude Code runs the subagent or teammate on a fallback model rather than failing the request. See [Choose a model](/docs/en/sub-agents#choose-a-model) for the subagent fallback and [Specify teammates and models](/docs/en/agent-teams#specify-teammates-and-models) for the teammate fallback.

  In interactive sessions, Claude Code warns you when it substitutes a subagent's model, by this fallback or by the newest-permitted-version substitution above, naming the requested and substituted models; it doesn't report a teammate's fallback.

  Where the newest-permitted-version substitution above operates, a blocked family alias follows it instead. Before v2.1.222, an alias fell back like any other blocked value on every provider
* **Skill or command override**: Claude Code ignores the override, including a blocked family alias, and the skill or command runs on the session model. A skill or command that [runs in a subagent](/docs/en/skills#run-skills-in-a-subagent) follows the subagent behavior above instead
* **`advisorModel` setting**: the advisor is disabled for the session
* **`--advisor` flag**: Claude Code exits with an error at launch. In a [background session](/docs/en/agent-view), it starts the session without the advisor instead of exiting

Claude Code hides excluded models from the `/model` picker. A full model ID in the list that has no built-in picker row, such as an older version that the list pins, appears in the `/model` picker as its own labeled row, unless Claude Code replaces the built-in options with a [`modelPicker`](/docs/en/settings-reference#modelpicker) lineup. Before v2.1.199, such an ID was selectable only by typing `/model <id>`.

Model changes that Claude Code makes on your behalf are checked the same way:

* **[Fallback model chains](#fallback-model-chains)**: entries outside the allowlist are dropped
* **Plan-mode upgrades**: on the Anthropic API and Claude Platform on AWS, an upgrade such as [`opusplan`](#opusplan-model-setting) to an excluded model uses the newest permitted version of the upgrade family. On providers with provider-specific model IDs, and when no version is permitted, the upgrade is skipped and planning continues on the session's model
* **[Automatic model fallback](#automatic-model-fallback)**: a fallback whose target is excluded does not run, so the flagged request ends with a refusal instead
* **[Auto mode classifier](/docs/en/permission-modes#eliminate-prompts-with-auto-mode)**: the classifier's Claude Sonnet 5 default applies only when the allowlist permits Sonnet 5. When it's excluded, the classifier runs on the session's model, which the allowlist already governs, or on an Opus model when the session runs on a [Fable model](#work-with-fable). On providers other than the Anthropic API, that Opus fallback runs on the provider's default Opus model without consulting the allowlist. Requires Claude Code v2.1.210 or later
* **[Fast mode](/docs/en/fast-mode)**: enabling fast mode is refused when the model the session would run on afterward is outside the allowlist

```json theme={null}
{
  "availableModels": ["sonnet", "haiku"]
}
```

### Surface coverage

Every surface enforces the allowlist it receives. Which delivery mechanism reaches each surface differs:

| Delivery mechanism                                                            | CLI and IDE | Desktop local sessions | Web, mobile, and cloud sessions                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Agent SDK and non-interactive | Cowork                  |

* Cloud sessions, on [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) or in the Desktop app, run on Anthropic-managed VMs by default: settings deployed to your device do not reach them, so deliver the allowlist through server-managed settings. Sessions your organization routes to a [self-hosted environment](/docs/en/self-hosted-environments) run on your own compute and also read the managed settings file in the runner image. [How Claude Code combines managed sources](/docs/en/managed-settings#how-claude-code-combines-managed-sources) says when that file applies. A mid-session model switch in a cloud session is rejected when the requested model is excluded by the allowlist. Server-side rejection at session creation applies to [organization model restrictions](#organization-model-restrictions), not the `availableModels` settings key.
* Cowork, the agentic-work tab in the Claude Desktop app, runs its sessions on Claude Code but, by design, does not receive server-managed settings from the claude.ai admin console. A managed settings file applies to Cowork sessions when it is present where the session runs; remote Cowork sessions run on Anthropic-managed VMs, where a device-deployed file is not present.
* Sessions on [third-party providers](/docs/en/server-managed-settings#platform-availability) such as Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, Microsoft Foundry, and [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/claude-platform-on-aws) do not receive server-managed settings, so deliver the allowlist through MDM or managed settings files there.
* Server-managed delivery also requires the session to authenticate with an [eligible login or key](/docs/en/server-managed-settings#platform-availability). Fleets that generate keys only through an [`apiKeyHelper`](/docs/en/settings-reference#apikeyhelper) script should deliver the allowlist through MDM or managed settings files.
* The Desktop Code tab also hosts [SSH sessions](/docs/en/desktop#ssh-sessions), which read the managed settings file from the remote host they run on. See [Desktop managed settings](/docs/en/desktop#managed-settings).
* The model pickers on claude.ai and in the Desktop app hide or grey out models excluded by your organization's allowlist. The picker state is a convenience for users; enforcement happens in the session.

### Default model behavior

On its own, `availableModels` leaves the Default option on the system's [runtime default](#default-model-setting) for the account until you also set [`enforceAvailableModels`](#enforce-the-allowlist-for-the-default-model). If that default is a model you intend to restrict, set `enforceAvailableModels` as well.

An empty `availableModels` array never engages the Default-model enforcement: with `availableModels: []`, named model selections are blocked but the Default model for the account type remains usable regardless of `enforceAvailableModels`.

### Enforce the allowlist for the Default model

Set `enforceAvailableModels: true` alongside a non-empty `availableModels` in managed settings to extend the allowlist to the Default option. This requires Claude Code v2.1.175 or later.

```json theme={null}
{
  "availableModels": ["sonnet", "haiku"],
  "enforceAvailableModels": true
}
```

The Default option resolves to the account-type default, or to the [organization default model](#organization-default-model) when an admin has set one. When that model is not in the allowlist, the Default option instead resolves to the first `availableModels` entry that names an allowed, available model, and the `/model` picker's Default row shows that model. This applies everywhere the default is reached: session startup, selecting Default in `/model`, the `"default"` keyword in [fallback model chains](#fallback-model-chains), and the fallback used when an excluded selection is dropped.

`enforceAvailableModels` remaps the Default option only when `availableModels` is non-empty. With `availableModels: []`, the Default model for the account type remains usable, so the setting cannot lock users out of every model. When `availableModels` is non-empty but no entry resolves to an allowed and available model, enforcement is skipped and Default resolves to the account-type default, with a warning visible only under `--debug`. Keep at least one guaranteed-available entry in the list to avoid this.

Deploy both keys together in the highest-ranked managed source you deliver. By default Claude Code reads only that source, so a pair placed in a managed settings file is ignored when the admin console delivers any settings; under the opt-in merge in [how Claude Code combines managed sources](/docs/en/managed-settings#how-claude-code-combines-managed-sources), Claude Code still ignores a `modelOverrides` map from a source ranked below the one that sets `availableModels`.

### Control the model users run on

The `model` setting is an initial selection, not enforcement. It sets which model is active when a session starts, but users can still open `/model` and pick Default, which resolves to the system's [runtime default](#default-model-setting) regardless of what `model` is set to, unless [`enforceAvailableModels`](#enforce-the-allowlist-for-the-default-model) redirects it.

To fully control the model experience, combine these settings:

* **`availableModels`**: restricts which named models users can switch to
* **`enforceAvailableModels`**: extends the `availableModels` allowlist to the Default option, so Default cannot resolve to a model outside the list
* **`model`**: sets the initial model selection when a session starts
* **`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`** / **`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`** / **`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`** / **`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`**: control what the `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, and `fable` aliases resolve to, and which version the [account-type default](#default-model-setting) uses

This example starts users on Sonnet 4.5, limits the picker to Sonnet and Haiku, and ensures Default resolves to a model on the allowlist rather than the tier default:

```json theme={null}
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "availableModels": ["claude-sonnet-4-5", "haiku"],
  "enforceAvailableModels": true,
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "claude-sonnet-4-5"
  }
}
```

Without `enforceAvailableModels` or the `env` block, a user who selects Default in the picker gets the [runtime default](#default-model-setting) rather than the version pinned in `model`. The two settings cover different scopes: `enforceAvailableModels` makes Default obey the allowlist, while the `env` block pins which version a permitted alias such as `sonnet` resolves to. Use `enforceAvailableModels` alone when restricting model families is enough; add the `env` block when you also need to pin a specific version.

### Merge behavior

When the managed settings Claude Code applies define `availableModels`, that list alone applies, apart from a [host platform that supplies its own](/docs/en/settings#exceptions-to-managed-settings-precedence): entries in user, project, or local settings cannot extend it, and Claude Code never merges `availableModels` across managed sources either; [how Claude Code combines managed sources](/docs/en/managed-settings#how-claude-code-combines-managed-sources) says which source's list applies. Otherwise, lists from user, project, and local settings are [concatenated and deduplicated](/docs/en/settings#settings-precedence) like other array settings. Before Claude Code v2.1.175, entries from lower-precedence scopes merged into the managed list instead of being replaced by it.

Within the effective list, an entry naming a specific model in a family, whether a version prefix or a full model ID, disables that family's wildcard entry: `["sonnet", "claude-sonnet-4-5"]` allows only Sonnet 4.5 versions, not every Sonnet model.

### Mantle model IDs

When the [Amazon Bedrock Mantle endpoint](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock#use-the-mantle-endpoint) is enabled, entries in `availableModels` that start with `anthropic.` are added to the `/model` picker as custom options and routed to the Mantle endpoint. This is an exception to the alias matching described in [Pin models for third-party deployments](#pin-models-for-third-party-deployments). The setting still restricts the picker to listed entries, and a Mantle ID embeds a family name, so it counts as a specific entry and disables that family's wildcard: alongside any Mantle IDs, list the version prefixes or full IDs you want to keep selectable. See [Merge behavior](#merge-behavior).

### Organization model restrictions

Organization admins on Claude Enterprise plans restrict which models members can run by disabling individual models in the claude.ai admin console. This restriction is delivered with the account's entitlements when Claude Code authenticates, separate from any `availableModels` list in settings, and the server enforces the same restriction independently when a session is created. Requires Claude Code v2.1.187 or later.

The restriction applies when a member signs in or uses their own API key. Organization-scoped credentials, such as organization service keys, are not tied to a user, so the restriction does not apply to them.

The Claude Console has no model restriction control. Organizations without a Claude Enterprise plan, including those whose members authenticate through the Anthropic API, restrict models with [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection) in [managed settings](/docs/en/managed-settings) instead, adding [`enforceAvailableModels`](#enforce-the-allowlist-for-the-default-model) to cover the Default option. These settings are enforced by Claude Code itself, not by the server.

A restricted model is hidden from the `/model` picker. Selecting it by name with `--model`, the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable, or the `model` setting shows the notice `Model "<name>" is restricted by your organization's settings. Using <model> instead.` and the session starts on an allowed model. Typing `/model <name>` for a restricted model is rejected with `Model '<name>' is restricted by your organization's settings. Run /model to choose a different model.` and the session keeps its current model.

A [model family alias](#restrict-model-selection) such as `opus` resolves to its usual model when the organization permits it. When the organization restricts that model, Claude Code substitutes the newest version of the family that the organization permits, with the same substitution notice. `/model <alias>` is rejected only when every version of its family is restricted; an alias set with `--model`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, or the `model` setting is still replaced at startup in that case. Before v2.1.205, a family alias was substituted or rejected based on its newest released version alone, even when an older version was allowed.

Restrictions apply org-wide or per role:

* Disabling a model at the organization level removes it for every member.
* Role-level access grants different models to different custom roles, and a member who holds several roles can use any model that one of their roles grants.
* Haiku models are always available and can't be disabled, so every member keeps at least one usable model.
* An access change takes effect on new requests within about a minute; the `/model` picker reflects it the next time a session starts.

Both restrictions apply together: a model is selectable only when it is permitted by `availableModels` and not restricted by the organization. Organization restrictions reach sessions on the Anthropic API and [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway) deployments only; on any other provider, use `availableModels` instead.

## Organization default model

Organization admins on Claude Enterprise plans can set a default model for Claude Code members from the claude.ai admin console, for the whole organization or per custom role. When one is set, the Default option resolves to that model. Requires Claude Code v2.1.196 or later.

The Default row in the `/model` picker shows the organization default's name with the label Org default. The label reads Org default whether the admin set the default for the whole organization or for your role. A role default covers members of that custom role and takes precedence over the organization-wide default; when several of your roles set different defaults, the most capable model applies.

The organization default is a starting point, not a restriction. These selections take precedence over it:

* the `--model` flag and the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable
* a `model` value in [managed settings](/docs/en/managed-settings) or supplied through `--settings`
* a `model` value in your user, project, or local settings, including a model you save with `/model`

Admins can also configure the organization default to override user selection. With override on, it takes precedence over the `model` value in user, project, and local settings, so a model you save with `/model` applies for the current session and the organization default returns on the next launch. When your selection differs, `/model` shows `Your organization's default (<model>) applies on restart`. The `--model` flag, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, managed settings, and `--settings` still take precedence even with override on. Override is available to a limited set of organizations; ask your Anthropic account team about availability.

To limit which models members can select, use [organization model restrictions](#organization-model-restrictions) or [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection) instead.

Claude Code reads the organization default once at startup, so a default the admin changes mid-session takes effect on the next launch.

When the organization default doesn't override user selection, the first interactive launch after the admin changes it clears the `model` key from your user settings once, so the new default applies. It changes nothing else in the file, and a model you save with `/model` after that launch is kept.

The organization default passes through these restriction checks before it is adopted:

* [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection) on its own doesn't apply to the organization default, so an organization default outside the allowlist still applies. When [`enforceAvailableModels`](#enforce-the-allowlist-for-the-default-model) is also set, an organization default outside the allowlist is remapped to the first allowlist entry, like any other Default
* an organization default that [organization model restrictions](#organization-model-restrictions) deny for your account is replaced by the newest allowed model in its family, or a lower-cost family when every version of it is restricted
* an organization default that isn't available to your account at all is skipped, and the Default option resolves as it would [without an organization default](#default-model-setting)

As of v2.1.199, when the organization default is a different model family from your account type's usual default, the `/model` picker keeps a separate row for that usual family, so you can still switch to it for a session. In v2.1.196 through v2.1.198 that row is missing from the picker.

The organization default reaches only sessions authenticated with the Anthropic API. To set a default anywhere else, including [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway) deployments, use the `model` key in [managed settings](/docs/en/managed-settings) instead.

## Organization effort limits

Organization admins on Claude Enterprise plans can set a maximum [effort level](#adjust-effort-level) per model for each custom role, alongside role-level [organization model restrictions](#organization-model-restrictions). Levels above the cap aren't offered in the `/effort` picker, and naming a higher level with `--effort` or `/effort` runs at the cap instead. In interactive sessions and plain-text `--print` runs, a warning names the requested and applied levels; with `json` or `stream-json` output or in background agents, the clamp applies silently. Caps are per model, so switching models can change which levels are available. When several of your roles grant the same model, the least restrictive cap applies. Requires Claude Code v2.1.195 or later.

Effort limits are delivered together with [organization model restrictions](#organization-model-restrictions) and reach the same sessions.

## Special model behavior

### `default` model setting

The behavior of `default` depends on your account type:

* **Max, Team Premium, Enterprise, and Anthropic API**: defaults to Opus 5
* **Claude Platform on AWS, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Agent Platform**: defaults to Opus 5
* **Pro and Team Standard**: defaults to Sonnet 5
* **Microsoft Foundry**: defaults to Sonnet 4.5

Before v2.1.219, `default` resolved to Opus 4.8 on the Anthropic API, Max, Team Premium, and Enterprise pay-as-you-go from v2.1.154, and on Claude Platform on AWS, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud's Agent Platform from v2.1.207. Before v2.1.207, `default` resolved to Opus 4.7 on Claude Platform on AWS and to Sonnet 4.5 on Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud's Agent Platform.

When an admin has set an [organization default model](#organization-default-model), `default` resolves to that model instead of the account-type default above. Requires Claude Code v2.1.196 or later. `default` can also resolve to the model you set with [`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL`](#set-a-default-model-for-new-sessions), under the conditions listed in its section.

When managed settings [enforce the allowlist for the Default model](#enforce-the-allowlist-for-the-default-model) and the account-type default is not in `availableModels`, `default` resolves to the enforced Default instead of the account-type default above. When both apply, the organization default replaces the account-type default first and enforcement then applies to it: an allowlisted organization default is kept, while one outside the list resolves to the enforced Default.

Fable models are not the account-type default on any plan or provider. Choosing one with `/model` saves it as the selected model in your user settings, so later sessions start on it. For the one-time change Claude Code makes to a saved Fable 5 selection in v2.1.255, see [Work with Fable](#work-with-fable).

### `opusplan` model setting

The `opusplan` model alias provides an automated hybrid approach:

* **In plan mode**: uses `opus` for complex reasoning and architecture decisions
* **In execution mode**: automatically switches to `sonnet` for code generation and implementation

This pairs Opus's reasoning for planning with Sonnet's efficiency for execution.

The plan-mode Opus phase uses the same context window as the `opus` model setting. On subscription tiers where Opus is [automatically upgraded to 1M context](#extended-context), `opusplan` receives the upgrade in plan mode as well. To force 1M context for both phases when you are not on an auto-upgrade tier, set the model to `opusplan[1m]`.

When [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection) excludes the newest Opus but permits an older version, for example `["sonnet", "claude-opus-4-6"]`, `opusplan` uses the newest permitted Opus for planning and stays on Sonnet only when every Opus is excluded. A Haiku session that would normally upgrade to Sonnet in plan mode likewise uses the newest permitted Sonnet, and stays on Haiku only when every Sonnet is excluded. Before v2.1.205, plan mode stayed on the session's model whenever the newest version of the upgrade family was excluded, even when the allowlist permitted an older one.

The substitution of an older permitted version applies on the Anthropic API and [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/claude-platform-on-aws). On Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, Microsoft Foundry, and Mantle, whose deployments use provider-specific model IDs, plan mode stays on the session's model whenever the upgrade model is excluded.

For a hybrid approach where Claude decides mid-task when to consult a second model rather than switching at the plan boundary, see the [advisor tool](/docs/en/advisor).

### Fallback model chains

When the primary model is overloaded, unavailable, or returns another non-retryable server error, Claude Code can switch to a fallback model instead of failing the request. Authentication, billing, rate-limit, request-size, and transport errors, and a [denial by your organization's policy check](/docs/en/errors#automatic-retries), never trigger a switch; those follow their normal retry and error handling.

Configure one or more fallback models and Claude Code tries them in order, showing a notice when it switches. The switch lasts for the current turn only, so your next message tries the primary model first again. Claude Code caps chains at three models after duplicate removal and ignores extra entries.

Set a chain for one session with the `--fallback-model` flag, which accepts a comma-separated list:

```bash theme={null}
claude --fallback-model sonnet,haiku
```

To persist a chain across sessions, set `fallbackModel` in [settings](/docs/en/settings) as an array:

```json theme={null}
{
  "fallbackModel": ["claude-sonnet-5", "claude-haiku-4-5"]
}
```

The `--fallback-model` flag takes precedence over the `fallbackModel` setting. Each entry accepts a model name or alias, and `"default"` expands to the default model.

Claude Code doesn't confirm the chain at startup and `/status` doesn't display it. The notice shown when a switch happens is the first visible sign that a fallback is configured.

When a request fails over, Claude Code tries each entry in order until one accepts it. An entry that can't be reached either, such as a retired model pinned in settings, fails over to the next one the same way. Claude Code removes two kinds of entry before that walk starts:

* **Outside the allowlist**: Claude Code drops any entry not permitted by [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection) when it reads the chain.
* **Smaller context window during compaction**: the chain also covers [compaction](/docs/en/context-window#what-survives-compaction), but Claude Code won't fall back to a model with a smaller context window than the primary's, since summarizing there would cut off part of the conversation first. If every fallback is smaller, compaction shows the original error and you can retry.

Claude Code also applies the chain to [subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents). When a subagent's request fails over, Claude Code tries your configured fallback models in order, and the subagent continues on the model that accepts the request. Your session's model is unchanged. Before v2.1.247, a failure the chain covers ended the subagent instead.

### Automatic model fallback

This section covers content-based fallback from Fable models and Opus 5. For availability-based fallback when a model is overloaded or unavailable, see [Fallback model chains](#fallback-model-chains).

Fable models and Opus 5 run with safety classifiers, which most often flag cybersecurity and biology content. When a classifier flags a request and the flagged category has a fallback model, Claude Code re-runs the request on that model and shows a notice in the transcript. For those two categories, the fallback model depends on which model refused:

* **Fable 5.1 and Fable 5**: biology-flagged requests re-run on Opus 5, and cybersecurity-flagged requests re-run on Opus 4.8.
* **Opus 5**: cybersecurity-flagged requests re-run on Opus 4.8. Biology-flagged requests end with a refusal instead, because Opus 5 runs its own biology classifiers with no fallback model.

On Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry, Claude Code resolves these targets through your deployment instead, and if you set `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, categories that have a fallback re-run on the pinned model; see [Enable fallback on Bedrock, Agent Platform, and Foundry](#enable-fallback-on-bedrock-agent-platform-and-foundry).

After a fallback, the session continues on the fallback model. To return to your original model, run [`/model`](#setting-your-model).

Category-based fallback requires Claude Code v2.1.219 or later. Before v2.1.219, every flagged Fable 5 request re-ran on your provider's default Opus model, and Opus 5 was not a fallback source.

The fallback model is checked against [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection). When it is blocked, no fallback occurs. The refusal is shown as a normal error and the session's model is unchanged.

#### Check what triggered fallback

Fallback can trigger on the first request of a session, before you send anything unusual, because the first request carries workspace context such as your CLAUDE.md content and git status. A repository that contains security or biology material can trip the classifier on that context alone.

To check whether customizations are the trigger, start a session with `claude --safe-mode`, which disables customizations such as CLAUDE.md, skills, MCP servers, and hooks. Git status and directory names are not customizations and are still included.

#### Ask before switching

To decide what happens each time a request is flagged, rather than switching automatically, run `/config` and turn off **Switch models when a message is flagged**, or set [`switchModelsOnFlag`](/docs/en/settings-reference#switchmodelsonflag) to `false` in your settings file. A flagged request then pauses the session with two options: switch to the fallback model, or edit the prompt and retry on the current model.

Some cases behave differently:

* When the flagged category has no fallback model, such as a biology flag on Opus 5, Claude Code doesn't show the prompt and the request ends with the refusal.
* If both models flag the same request, you can edit the prompt and retry, or start a new session.
* On mobile [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) sessions, editing and retrying is not supported. Switch models, or continue the session from a desktop browser or the desktop app.
* In [non-interactive mode](/docs/en/cli-reference#cli-flags) and SDK integrations that can't show the prompt, a flagged request ends the turn with a refusal instead.
* When the fallback target is blocked by [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection), Claude Code doesn't show the prompt. The flagged request ends with the refusal, the same as automatic fallback when the target is blocked.

#### Enable fallback on Bedrock, Agent Platform, and Foundry

On [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Cloud's Agent Platform](/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), and [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/microsoft-foundry), model IDs are provider-specific, so automatic fallback only operates when Claude Code can identify both models involved:

* Claude Code must recognize the current model as a fallback source. Fable 5.1 and Fable 5 are recognized when the model ID contains `claude-fable-5`, matches the value of `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`, or is mapped with [`modelOverrides`](#override-model-ids-per-version). Opus 5 is recognized by its provider model ID or a [`modelOverrides`](#override-model-ids-per-version) mapping.
* The fallback model must resolve in your deployment. If you set `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, flagged requests re-run on that model for every category that has a fallback; a biology flag on Opus 5 still ends with a refusal. If you don't set it, cybersecurity-flagged requests re-run on an Opus 4.8 entry in the provider's model list, and biology-flagged requests from a Fable model on an Opus 5 entry.

If either model can't be identified, Claude Code does not switch automatically. The flagged request ends with a refusal message, and you can switch models with [`/model`](#setting-your-model) and retry. Setting `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL` to your Fable model ID enables Fable recognition. Setting `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` to an Opus model ID gives the flagged categories a fallback target, unless the pin names a model outside the Opus family or the model that refused; then Claude Code doesn't switch and the refusal stands.

#### Security research and biology workloads

Workloads in offensive security or biology, including penetration testing, Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises, and biology-adjacent codebases, trigger fallback frequently, often on the first request. For substantive biology work on Fable 5.1 or Fable 5, Claude Code moves the session to Opus 5 at the first flagged request, and later biology-flagged requests end in refusals there, because Opus 5 has no biology fallback. On Opus 5, you get those refusals from the first flagged request.

This is expected routing for these domains, not an account flag. If your organization needs Fable-class capability for this work, ask your Anthropic account team about trusted access programs.

### Adjust effort level

[Effort levels](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) control adaptive reasoning, which lets the model decide whether and how much to think on each step based on task complexity. Lower effort is faster and cheaper for straightforward tasks, while higher effort provides deeper reasoning for complex problems.

The available effort levels depend on the model. Models not listed here do not support effort:

| Model                                    | Levels                                  |
| :--------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Fable 5.1 and Fable 5                    | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| Opus 5, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8, and Opus 4.7 | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` |
| Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6                  | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`          |

If you set a level the active model does not support, Claude Code falls back to the highest supported level at or below the one you set. For example, `xhigh` runs as `high` on Opus 4.6. Your organization can also cap which levels are available for a model; see [Organization effort limits](#organization-effort-limits).

With the [`ultracode`](/docs/en/settings-reference#ultracode) setting off, Claude Code resolves the session's effort level in this order, taking the first that applies:

1. An explicit choice: the [`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`](/docs/en/env-vars#variables) environment variable, launching with `--effort`, or `/effort` in the session ([a non-interactive `/effort` has narrower effect](#non-interactive-effort))
2. The model's default effort, on Fable 5, Opus 4.8, or Opus 4.7: from the first time you run one of these models, Claude Code holds that model's default effort across sessions, even when your settings resolve a different level, until you change effort once, for example with an interactive `/effort`, the `/model` picker's effort slider, or `--effort` at launch. Opus 5 and Fable 5.1 have no such hold
3. Your settings: the level you saved for the model or an [`effortLevel`](/docs/en/settings-reference#effortlevel) key, with the precedence between them and across settings files stated at [`modelSettings`](/docs/en/settings-reference#modelsettings)
4. The model's default effort: `high` on every model that supports effort, except that Opus 4.7 defaults to `xhigh` and, when your organization sets a default effort level for its [organization default model](#organization-default-model), that level is the default when you run that model

When you set `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh` in an interactive session on your machine, Claude Code saves the level and applies it in later sessions. It saves the level per model, under the [`modelSettings`](/docs/en/settings-reference#modelsettings) key in your user settings, so each model keeps its own saved level.

`max` is the deepest reasoning level. Unless you set it through the `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` environment variable, Claude Code applies `max` to the current session only.

<Note>
  A level you pick from the effort control on a phone or browser connected through [Remote Control](/docs/en/remote-control#what-connected-devices-see) applies to that session only.
</Note>

<span id="non-interactive-effort" />

A level set with `/effort` in [non-interactive mode](/docs/en/headless), with the `-p` flag, applies to the current session only and isn't saved as your default. It also doesn't count as the one change that ends the model-default step above on Fable 5, Opus 4.8, or Opus 4.7: while that step is in effect, a non-interactive `/effort` reports `Not applied`, so pass `--effort` at launch instead.

The `/effort` menu also offers `ultracode`. Ultracode is a Claude Code setting rather than a model effort level: it sends `xhigh` to the model and additionally has Claude orchestrate [dynamic workflows](/docs/en/workflows) for substantive tasks. For where it can be set persistently, see the [`ultracode`](/docs/en/settings-reference#ultracode) setting.

You can turn on ultracode through any of the following:

* **`/effort`**: run `/effort ultracode`, or select it from the menu
* **`--effort` flag**: launch with `claude --effort ultracode`, which starts the session at `xhigh` effort with ultracode on
* **`ultracode` setting**: set [`"ultracode": true`](/docs/en/settings-reference#ultracode) in a settings file, with `--settings`, or in an Agent SDK control request. An [`applyFlagSettings()`](/docs/en/agent-sdk/typescript#applyflagsettings) request also accepts `effortLevel: "ultracode"`
* **`/model` picker**: move the effort slider to `ultracode` with the arrow keys while you choose a model. Claude Code turns it on for the current session, even when you save that model as your default

Passing `ultracode` to the `--effort` flag or the Agent SDK `effortLevel` value requires Claude Code v2.1.203 or later. Before v2.1.203, `--effort ultracode` printed `Unknown --effort value 'ultracode'` and the session started at the default effort.

The persisted `effortLevel` setting and the `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` environment variable don't accept `ultracode`. When `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` is set to a level other than `xhigh`, requests run at that level and ultracode's workflow orchestration stays inactive. Selecting ultracode then shows a warning that the environment variable overrides effort for the session.

When ultracode isn't available, for example when [workflows are turned off](/docs/en/workflows#turn-workflows-off), `--effort ultracode` sets `xhigh` effort only.

#### Choose an effort level

Each level trades token spend against capability. The default suits most coding tasks; adjust when you want a different balance.

| Level       | When to use it                                                                                                                         |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `low`       | Reserve for short, scoped, latency-sensitive tasks that are not intelligence-sensitive                                                 |
| `medium`    | Reduces token usage for cost-sensitive work that can trade off some intelligence                                                       |
| `high`      | Balances token usage and intelligence. The default on every model except Opus 4.7                                                      |
| `xhigh`     | Deeper reasoning at higher token spend. The default on Opus 4.7                                                                        |
| `max`       | Can improve performance on demanding tasks but may show diminishing returns and is prone to overthinking. Test before adopting broadly |
| `ultracode` | A Claude Code setting that plans a [dynamic workflow](/docs/en/workflows) for each substantive task with `xhigh` per-message reasoning      |

The effort scale is calibrated per model, so the same level name does not represent the same underlying value across models.

#### Use ultrathink for one-off deep reasoning

Include `ultrathink` anywhere in your prompt to request deeper reasoning on that turn without changing your session effort setting. Claude Code recognizes the keyword and adds an in-context instruction. The effort level sent to the API is unchanged. Claude Code passes other phrases such as "think", "think hard", and "think more" through as ordinary prompt text and doesn't recognize them as keywords.

#### Set the effort level

You can change effort through any of the following:

* **`/effort`**: run `/effort` with no arguments to open an interactive slider, `/effort` followed by a level name to set it directly, or `/effort auto` to clear your saved level for the active model. You can run it while Claude is working, and once you confirm the [cache warning](/docs/en/prompt-caching#changing-effort-level), if Claude Code shows one, Claude Code applies the new level to the next request in the turn
* **In `/model`**: use left/right arrow keys to adjust the effort slider when selecting a model
* **`--effort` flag**: pass a level name to set it for a single session when launching Claude Code
* **Environment variable**: set `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` to a level name or `auto`
* **Settings**: set a per-model level in [`modelSettings`](/docs/en/settings-reference#modelsettings), or set [`effortLevel`](/docs/en/settings-reference#effortlevel) to `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh` as the default for models without one. `max` isn't accepted in either key, and `ultracode` has its own [`ultracode`](/docs/en/settings-reference#ultracode) key
* **From a connected device**: in a [Remote Control](/docs/en/remote-control#what-connected-devices-see) session, pick a level from the effort control on your phone or in your browser. The level applies to the current session only. Requires Claude Code v2.1.234 or later
* **Skill and subagent frontmatter**: set `effort` in a [skill](/docs/en/skills#frontmatter-reference) or [subagent](/docs/en/sub-agents#supported-frontmatter-fields) markdown file to override the effort level when that skill or subagent runs

Frontmatter effort applies when that skill or subagent is active, overriding the session level but not the environment variable.

The `effortLevel` key in [managed settings](/docs/en/managed-settings) is a starting default, not enforcement: users can change it for a session with `/effort` or `--effort`, and the managed value re-asserts as the default in new sessions.

The effort slider appears in `/model` when a supported model is selected. The current effort level is also shown in the session header next to the model name, for example "with low effort", so you can confirm which setting is active without opening `/model`. The footer also briefly shows the effort level at startup and when it changes.

#### Adaptive reasoning and fixed thinking budgets

Adaptive reasoning makes thinking optional on each step, so Claude can respond faster to routine prompts and reserve deeper thinking for steps that benefit from it. If you want Claude to think more or less often than the current level produces, you can say so directly in your prompt or in `CLAUDE.md`; the model responds to that guidance within its effort setting.

Fable 5.1, Fable 5, Sonnet 5, and Opus 4.7 and later always use adaptive reasoning. The fixed thinking budget mode and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING` do not apply to them.

On Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6, you can set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1` to revert to the previous fixed thinking budget controlled by `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS`. See [environment variables](/docs/en/env-vars).

### Extended thinking

Extended thinking is the reasoning Claude emits before responding. On models that support [adaptive reasoning](#adjust-effort-level), the effort level is the primary control for how much thinking happens; the settings below turn thinking on or off and control how it displays. With thinking turned off on the Anthropic API, Claude Code sends effort `high` instead of a higher level to models it knows [don't accept that combination](/docs/en/errors#effort-isnt-available-with-thinking-turned-off), such as Opus 5.

| Control                                 | How to set it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Other values apply only with a [fixed thinking budget](#adaptive-reasoning-and-fixed-thinking-budgets) |

Thinking cannot be turned off on Fable 5.1 or Fable 5. The session toggle, `alwaysThinkingEnabled`, and `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0` have no effect there, and the model decides per step how much to think based on the effort level.

Claude Code collapses thinking output by default. Press `Ctrl+O` to toggle verbose mode and see the reasoning as gray italic text. Interactive sessions on the Anthropic API receive redacted thinking blocks by default, so set `showThinkingSummaries: true` in [settings](/docs/en/settings) if you want the full summaries available when you expand. You are charged for all thinking tokens generated, even when collapsed or redacted.

### Extended context

Fable 5.1, Fable 5, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.6 and later, and Sonnet 4.6 support a [1 million token context window](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#context-window-sizes-by-model) for long sessions with large codebases.

Availability varies by model and plan. On the Anthropic API, Fable 5.1, Fable 5, Sonnet 5, and Opus 4.7 and later run with the 1M window by default.

On Max, Team, and Enterprise plans, including both Team Standard and Team Premium seats, Opus is automatically upgraded to 1M context with no additional configuration. Sonnet 4.6 with 1M context is not part of the automatic upgrade and requires [usage credits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12429409-extra-usage-for-paid-claude-plans) on every subscription plan, including Max.

| Plan                      | Opus with 1M context                                                                                        | Sonnet 4.6 with 1M context                                                                                  |

| Max, Team, and Enterprise | Included with subscription                                                                                  | Requires [usage credits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12429409-extra-usage-for-paid-claude-plans) |

| API and pay-as-you-go     | Full access                                                                                                 | Full access                                                                                                 |

Claude Code checks these plan requirements only when it connects to the Anthropic API directly. If you point `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at an [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway#subscriptions-and-gateways) and your saved claude.ai login stays the active credential, Claude Code doesn't check your plan's usage credits. The `[1m]` options stay available in `/model`, and the gateway decides whether the request succeeds. Before v2.1.229, Claude Code rejected `/model sonnet[1m]` in that configuration when it couldn't confirm usage credits on the account.

To turn off 1M context, set `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1`. Claude Code removes 1M model variants from the model picker. On models with a native 1M window, such as Sonnet 5 and the Fable models, it also treats the model as having a 200K context window:

* With auto-compaction on, sessions compact at the 200K boundary through [auto-compaction](#set-the-auto-compact-window). Setting the auto-compact window above 200K doesn't lift the hold, because Claude Code caps that window at the model's context window.
* With auto-compaction off, sessions stop at the 200K boundary with the [context-limit error](/docs/en/errors#prompt-is-too-long) instead of compacting.

Before v2.1.223, Claude Code held only Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8, and Opus 5 sessions to 200K. See [environment variables](/docs/en/env-vars).

The 1M context window uses standard model pricing with no premium for tokens beyond 200K. For plans where extended context is included with your subscription, usage remains covered by your subscription. For plans that access extended context through usage credits, tokens are billed to usage credits.

If your account supports 1M context, the option appears in the `/model` picker in the latest versions of Claude Code. If you don't see it, try restarting your session.

You can also use the `[1m]` suffix with model aliases or full model names:

```text theme={null}
# Use the opus[1m] or sonnet[1m] alias
/model opus[1m]
/model sonnet[1m]

# Or append [1m] to a full model name
/model claude-opus-4-8[1m]
```

#### Sonnet 5 context window

On the Anthropic API, Sonnet 5 always runs with the 1M context window. There is no 200K variant, no `[1m]` suffix to select, and no usage credits required on any plan. Sessions auto-compact before the window fills, at about 967K tokens by default; set [`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`](/docs/en/env-vars) to choose a different threshold.

Two configurations budget the window at 200K instead:

* **LLM gateway**: when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points at a [gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway), Claude Code can't verify 1M support. To use the full window, select Sonnet 5 (1M context) in the model picker, which maps to `sonnet[1m]`.
* **`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1`**: holds sessions on every model with a native 1M window to a 200K window; see [Extended context](#extended-context) for how the hold is enforced. Useful for deployments that need to cap context.

## Context window and auto-compaction

The auto-compact window is how full the context window can get before Claude Code compacts the conversation. For what compaction keeps and drops per mechanism, see [What survives compaction](/docs/en/context-window#what-survives-compaction).

### Set the auto-compact window

You can set the auto-compact window in three places:

* **For this session and later ones**: run `/autocompact` with a value, like `/autocompact 500k`. Claude Code saves it to your user settings as [`autoCompactWindow`](/docs/en/settings-reference#autocompactwindow) and applies it to the current session; if a higher-priority [settings scope](/docs/en/settings#settings-precedence) such as managed settings sets the key, the command saves your value but the session keeps that scope's window, and the command says so. Run `/autocompact auto` to return to the window tuned for your model.
* **For one launch**: pass [`--autocompact`](/docs/en/cli-reference#cli-flags) when starting Claude Code. The flag overrides your saved setting for that launch without changing it, and `claude --autocompact auto` runs the session at the tuned window even if your saved setting has a value. Unlike `/autocompact`, the flag isn't preempted by a higher-priority settings scope such as managed settings.
* **In scripts and cloud environments**: set [`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`](/docs/en/env-vars). While it's set, it takes precedence over the command, the flag, and the setting, and `/autocompact` reports the override instead of changing the window.

The command and the flag accept a window size from 100K to 1M tokens, in any of these forms:

* A plain token count, such as `200000`
* A `k` or `M` suffix, such as `500k` or `1M`
* A bare number from 100 to 1000, meaning thousands, so `200` sets 200,000

The environment variable accepts only the plain token count. Claude Code caps the window at the model's context window.

### Default auto-compact thresholds

If you don't set an auto-compact window, Claude Code compacts when the conversation reaches the model's context limit, except in these sessions:

* [Cloud sessions](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) compact as the conversation approaches the model's limit
* Sonnet 4.6 and Opus 4.6 without [extended context](#extended-context) compact at the 200K boundary, and so do Opus 4.8 and Opus 5 when they run with a 200K context window, such as on Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry
* When you set [`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1`](/docs/en/env-vars), models with a native 1M window, such as Sonnet 5 and the Fable models, compact at the 200K boundary
* Sonnet 5 compacts at the [threshold for its configuration](#sonnet-5-context-window)
* Sessions on a model ID Claude Code doesn't recognize, such as an [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway) alias, compact at the context window Claude Code assumes for the ID; see [Correct the window for a gateway or custom model ID](#correct-the-window-for-a-gateway-or-custom-model-id)

### Correct the window for a gateway or custom model ID

On an [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway) or other custom deployment, Claude Code can assume a context window for the model ID that differs from the model's real window, whether or not it resolves the ID to a Claude model. [`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`](/docs/en/env-vars) declares the window Claude Code should assume instead. How the variable applies depends on the ID. An unrecognized ID, an unrecognized `[1m]` ID, and an ID that starts with `claude-` or resolves to a Claude model are three separate cases:

* If the ID doesn't start with `claude-` or contain `[1m]`, in any casing, and Claude Code can't resolve it to a Claude model, the variable applies directly and proactive compaction continues at the declared window.
* If the ID doesn't start with `claude-` but contains `[1m]`, in any casing, and Claude Code can't resolve it to a Claude model, Claude Code assumes a 1M window for it and the variable doesn't apply on its own. To correct the window while keeping proactive compaction, also set [`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1`](/docs/en/env-vars). With a declared window above 200K, Claude Code then shows a [startup warning](/docs/en/errors#the-200k-limit-isnt-enforced) that the 200K limit isn't enforced. The warning is expected in this configuration.
* If the ID starts with `claude-` in any casing or resolves to a Claude model, the variable takes effect only when [`DISABLE_COMPACT`](/docs/en/env-vars) is also set, which disables all compaction. For example, Claude Code resolves an ID that contains a Claude model name, such as `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8` or `us.anthropic.claude-…-v1:0`, to that model. This includes IDs that also contain `[1m]`: Claude Code resolves `claude-opus-4-8[1m]` to Opus 4.8 even with `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT` set.

For a model ID Claude Code doesn't recognize, set [`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_UNKNOWN_MODEL_WINDOW_ENFORCEMENT=1`](/docs/en/env-vars) to have Claude Code compact only after the API rejects the conversation with a [too-long error Claude Code recognizes](/docs/en/errors#prompt-is-too-long). Claude Code doesn't run that recovery when a gateway [rewrites the error](/docs/en/llm-gateway-connect#troubleshoot-gateway-errors) to wording Claude Code doesn't recognize.

## Checking your current model

You can see which model you're currently using in two places:

* In the [status line](/docs/en/statusline), if you have one configured
* In `/status`, which also displays your account information

## Add a custom model option

Use `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` to add a single custom entry to the `/model` picker without replacing the built-in aliases. This is useful for testing model IDs that Claude Code does not list by default. For LLM gateway deployments, Claude Code can populate the picker from the gateway's `/v1/models` endpoint when `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` is set, so this variable is needed only when discovery is disabled or does not return the model you want. See [gateway model discovery](/docs/en/llm-gateway-protocol#model-discovery).

To list several models instead, in your own order and under labels you choose, set [`modelPicker`](/docs/en/settings-reference#modelpicker). Its entry says which rows the picker keeps when that lineup replaces the built-in one.

This example sets all three variables to make a gateway-routed Opus deployment selectable. Claude Code reads environment variables at startup, so run the exports before launching `claude`, or restart an existing session to pick them up:

```bash theme={null}
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION="my-gateway/claude-opus-5"
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_NAME="Opus via Gateway"
export ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_DESCRIPTION="Custom deployment routed through the internal LLM gateway"
```

`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_NAME` and `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_DESCRIPTION` are optional. If you omit the name, Claude Code uses the model ID; if you omit the description, Claude Code uses `Custom model (<model-id>)`. Claude Code lists the custom entry after the built-in entries, and any [`modelPicker`](/docs/en/settings-reference#modelpicker) rows you append come after it.

Claude Code skips validation for the model ID set in `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`, so you can use any string your API endpoint accepts.

When [`availableModels`](#restrict-model-selection) is set, include the custom model ID in the allowlist as well. Otherwise Claude Code filters the custom entry from the picker and rejects a `--model` selection of it like any other excluded model.

A custom ID that embeds a family name, such as `my-gateway/claude-opus-5`, counts as a specific entry for that family and disables its wildcard, so also list the versions you intend to keep selectable. See [Merge behavior](#merge-behavior).

## Environment variables

Use the following environment variables to control the model names that the aliases map to. Each value must be a full model name, or the equivalent identifier for your API provider. To choose the model your sessions start on, set [`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_MODEL`](#set-a-default-model-for-new-sessions), which this table omits.

| Environment variable             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`  | The model to use for `haiku`, or [background functionality](/docs/en/costs#background-token-usage)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL`     | The default model for [subagents](/docs/en/sub-agents#choose-a-model), [agent team](/docs/en/agent-teams#specify-teammates-and-models) teammates, and [workflow](/docs/en/workflows) agents that aren't assigned a model another way. Accepts an alias such as `haiku` or a full model name. A per-invocation model or a definition's `model` field, including `inherit`, takes precedence. To change that, set [`CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE`](/docs/en/sub-agents#choose-a-model) |

Note: `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` is deprecated in favor of
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`.

### Pin models for third-party deployments

When deploying Claude Code through [Amazon Bedrock](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Cloud's Agent Platform](/docs/en/google-vertex-ai), [Microsoft Foundry](/docs/en/microsoft-foundry), or [Claude Platform on AWS](/docs/en/claude-platform-on-aws), pin model versions before rolling out to users.

Without pinning, Claude Code uses model aliases such as `fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, and `haiku` that resolve to a built-in default model ID for each provider. That default can lag the newest Anthropic release, and the model it points to may not yet be enabled in a user's account. When the default is unavailable, Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud's Agent Platform users see a notice and the session falls back to an earlier version of the default model, or to the default Sonnet model when the default is an Opus model and no Opus version is available. Microsoft Foundry users see errors instead, because Microsoft Foundry has no equivalent startup check.

On Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud's Agent Platform, a user who starts the session on a specific Sonnet or Opus version, for example with `--model`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, or the `model` setting, pins that version as the session's default for the matching alias: the startup check skips the built-in default it replaces and shows no fallback notice. Before v2.1.211, the check ran and could show a notice even when a session model was explicitly configured.

<Warning>
  Set the model environment variables to specific version IDs as part of your initial setup. Pinning lets you control when your users move to a new model.
</Warning>

Use the following environment variables with version-specific model IDs for your provider:

| Provider                      | Example                                                              |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amazon Bedrock                | `export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8'` |
| Google Cloud's Agent Platform | `export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='claude-opus-4-8'`              |
| Microsoft Foundry             | `export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='claude-opus-4-8'`              |

Apply the same pattern for `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`. For current and legacy model IDs across all providers, see [Models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). To upgrade users to a new model version, update these environment variables and redeploy.

To enable [extended context](#extended-context) for a pinned model, append `[1m]` to the model ID in `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` or `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`:

```bash theme={null}
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='claude-opus-4-8[1m]'
```

The `[1m]` suffix applies the 1M context window to all usage of the `opus` and `sonnet` aliases, including the plan-mode Opus phase of [`opusplan`](#opusplan-model-setting).

* Claude Code strips the suffix before sending the model ID to your provider.
* Only append `[1m]` when the underlying model [supports 1M context](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/context-windows#context-window-sizes-by-model).
* The suffix is read per variable, not per model. On Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry, a model ID without `[1m]` in one variable uses 200K context even if another variable sets the same model with the suffix. Sonnet 5 always runs with the 1M window on these providers and never needs the suffix.

<Note>
  An `availableModels` allowlist delivered through [MDM or a managed settings file](/docs/en/managed-settings#delivery-mechanisms) still applies when using third-party providers; [server-managed settings are not delivered there](/docs/en/server-managed-settings#platform-availability). Filtering matches on a model alias such as `opus`, a version prefix such as `claude-opus-4-8`, or the full provider-form model ID. Provider-specific prefixes such as `us.anthropic.` are not stripped, so to allow a specific model, list the same provider-form ID the picker shows, or map it through [`modelOverrides`](#override-model-ids-per-version). Any `[1m]` suffix is stripped from both the allowlist entry and the requested model before matching.
</Note>

### Customize pinned model display and capabilities

When you pin a model on a third-party provider, the provider-specific ID appears as-is in the `/model` picker and Claude Code may not recognize which features the model supports. You can override the display name and declare capabilities with companion environment variables for each pinned model.

These variables take effect on third-party providers such as Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry. The `_NAME` and `_DESCRIPTION` variables also take effect when `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` points to an [LLM gateway](/docs/en/llm-gateway). They have no effect when connecting directly to `api.anthropic.com`.

| Environment variable                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL_NAME`                   | Display name for the pinned Opus model in the `/model` picker. Defaults to the model ID when not set                                                                                                                                                       |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL_DESCRIPTION`            | Display description for the pinned Opus model in the `/model` picker. When not set, defaults to `Custom Opus model`, or `Custom Opus model (1M context)` if the pinned model ID has the `[1m]` suffix and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT` isn't turned on |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES` | Comma-separated list of capabilities the pinned Opus model supports                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The same `_NAME`, `_DESCRIPTION`, and `_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES` suffixes are available for `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_FABLE_MODEL`, and `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`.

Claude Code enables features like [effort levels](#adjust-effort-level) and [extended thinking](#extended-thinking) by matching the model ID against known patterns. Provider-specific IDs such as Amazon Bedrock ARNs or custom deployment names often don't match these patterns, leaving supported features disabled. Set `_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES` to tell Claude Code which features the model actually supports:

| Capability value       | Enables                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `effort`               | [Effort levels](#adjust-effort-level) and the `/effort` command                 |
| `xhigh_effort`         | The `xhigh` effort level                                                        |
| `max_effort`           | The `max` effort level                                                          |
| `thinking`             | [Extended thinking](#extended-thinking)                                         |
| `adaptive_thinking`    | Adaptive reasoning that dynamically allocates thinking based on task complexity |
| `interleaved_thinking` | Thinking between tool calls                                                     |

When `_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES` is set, Claude Code enables the listed capabilities and disables the unlisted ones for the matching pinned model. When the variable is unset, Claude Code falls back to built-in detection based on the model ID.

This example pins Opus to an Amazon Bedrock custom model ARN, sets a friendly name, and declares its capabilities:

```bash theme={null}
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL='arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:123456789012:custom-model/abc'
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL_NAME='Opus via Bedrock'
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL_DESCRIPTION='Opus 4.7 routed through a Bedrock custom endpoint'
export ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES='effort,xhigh_effort,max_effort,thinking,adaptive_thinking,interleaved_thinking'
```

### Override model IDs per version

On platforms that embed Claude Code and set [`CLAUDE_CODE_PROVIDER_MANAGED_BY_HOST`](/docs/en/env-vars), the host's model configuration takes precedence over managed model settings, while a managed `availableModels` allowlist stays in force unless the host supplies its own; [Exceptions to managed settings precedence](/docs/en/settings#exceptions-to-managed-settings-precedence) says which keys and variables the host overrides.

The family-level environment variables above configure one model ID per family alias. If you need to map several versions within the same family to distinct provider IDs, use the `modelOverrides` setting instead.

`modelOverrides` maps individual Anthropic model IDs to the provider-specific strings that Claude Code sends to your provider's API. When a user selects a mapped model in the `/model` picker, Claude Code uses your configured value instead of the built-in default.

This lets enterprise administrators route each model version to a specific Amazon Bedrock inference profile ARN, Google Cloud's Agent Platform version name, or Microsoft Foundry deployment name for governance, cost allocation, or regional routing.

Set `modelOverrides` in your [settings file](/docs/en/settings#where-settings-live):

```json theme={null}
{
  "modelOverrides": {
    "claude-opus-4-7": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2:123456789012:application-inference-profile/opus-prod",
    "claude-opus-4-6": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2:123456789012:application-inference-profile/opus-46-prod",
    "claude-sonnet-4-6": "arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-2:123456789012:application-inference-profile/sonnet-prod"
  }
}
```

Keys must be Anthropic model IDs as listed in the [Models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview). For dated model IDs, include the date suffix exactly as it appears there. Unknown keys are ignored.

To stop the `[claude-code:unrecognized_model]` [diagnostic line](/docs/en/errors#unrecognized-model-id-on-a-request) for an ID such as a gateway alias, add an entry with that ID as its value.

Overrides replace the built-in model IDs that back each entry in the `/model` picker. On Amazon Bedrock, `modelOverrides` entries take precedence over any inference profiles that Claude Code discovers automatically at startup. Claude Code passes values that are already provider-native, such as Amazon Bedrock inference profile ARNs or Microsoft Foundry deployment names, to the provider as-is.

Overrides also apply when you pass an Anthropic model ID directly through `--model`, the `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` environment variable, or an `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` environment variable. On Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and [Mantle](/docs/en/amazon-bedrock#use-the-mantle-endpoint), an Anthropic model ID with no `modelOverrides` entry resolves to the same provider-specific ID as the `/model` picker row for that version, when the provider supports that version. Mantle supports a subset of versions. For an Anthropic model ID outside that subset, Claude Code sends the raw ID to Mantle without mapping it, unless a `modelOverrides` entry covers it. Before v2.1.200, `--model` and the environment-variable values reached the provider as-is without going through the override map.

`modelOverrides` works alongside `availableModels`. The allowlist is evaluated against the Anthropic model ID, not the override value, so an entry like `"opus"` in `availableModels` continues to match even when Opus versions are mapped to ARNs. When `enforceAvailableModels` is set in managed settings, the enforced Default resolves through `modelOverrides` from [managed settings](/docs/en/managed-settings#how-claude-code-combines-managed-sources) only. An admin's mapping, such as a version pinned to an inference profile ARN, is honored in the enforced Default. Overrides from user or project settings do not affect it.

When `availableModels` is set in [managed settings](/docs/en/managed-settings), only `modelOverrides` from managed settings apply to an Anthropic model ID passed directly through `--model` or the environment variables above. Claude Code ignores overrides in user or project settings for those IDs, and never resolves an ID the managed list excludes through `modelOverrides` from any settings source. This managed-source restriction requires Claude Code v2.1.200 or later. See [Restrict model selection](#restrict-model-selection) for how blocked IDs are handled.

### Prompt caching configuration

Claude Code automatically uses [prompt caching](/docs/en/prompt-caching) to optimize performance and reduce costs. You can disable prompt caching globally or for specific model tiers:

| Environment variable            | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING`        | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for all models. Takes precedence over the per-model settings |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_HAIKU`  | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Haiku models only                                        |
| `DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_SONNET` | Set to `1` to disable prompt caching for Sonnet models only                                       |
