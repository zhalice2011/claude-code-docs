# Use Claude Code on the web

> Configure cloud environments, setup scripts, network access, and Docker in Anthropic's sandbox. Move sessions between web and terminal with `--cloud` and `--teleport`.

<Note>
  Claude Code on the web is in research preview for Pro, Max, and Team users, and for Enterprise users with premium seats or Chat + Claude Code seats.
</Note>

Claude Code on the web runs tasks on Anthropic-managed cloud infrastructure at [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code). Sessions persist even if you close your browser, and you can monitor them from the Claude mobile app.

<Tip>
  New to Claude Code on the web? Start with [Get started](/en/web-quickstart) to connect your GitHub account and submit your first task.

## GitHub authentication options

Cloud sessions need access to your GitHub repositories to clone code and push branches. You can grant access in two ways:

| Method           | How it works                                                                                | Best for                                                                |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub App**   | Authorize the Claude GitHub App during [web onboarding](/en/web-quickstart).                | Browser onboarding; teams that want [Auto-fix](#auto-fix-pull-requests) |
| **`/web-setup`** | Run `/web-setup` in your terminal to sync your local `gh` CLI token to your Claude account. | Individual developers who already use `gh`                              |

<Note>
  With either method, a cloud session can access any repository the connecting GitHub account can see, not just the repositories the Claude GitHub App is installed on. App installation enables PR webhooks for [Auto-fix](#auto-fix-pull-requests); it is not a session-level access control. To restrict which repositories your team can reach from cloud sessions, restrict access on GitHub itself, for example by limiting team or repository membership for the connected GitHub accounts.
</Note>

Either method works. [`/schedule`](/en/routines) checks for either form of access and prompts you to run `/web-setup` if neither is configured. See [Connect from your terminal](/en/web-quickstart#connect-from-your-terminal) for the `/web-setup` walkthrough.

The GitHub App is required for [Auto-fix](#auto-fix-pull-requests), which uses the App to receive PR webhooks. If you connect with `/web-setup` and later want Auto-fix, install the App on those repositories.

Team and Enterprise Owners can disable `/web-setup` with the Quick web setup toggle at [claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code).

<Note>
  Organizations with [Zero Data Retention](/en/zero-data-retention) enabled can't use `/web-setup` or other cloud session features.
</Note>

## The cloud environment

Each session runs in a fresh Anthropic-managed VM with your repository cloned. This section covers what's available when a session starts and how to customize it.

### What's available in cloud sessions

Cloud sessions start from a fresh clone of your repository. Anything committed to the repo is available. Anything you've installed or configured only on your own machine isn't available in the session. Your organization's policy arrives separately through [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings).

To make your own configuration available in cloud sessions, commit it to the repo; organization policy arrives separately through [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings).

A dedicated secrets store is not yet available. Both environment variables and setup scripts are stored in the environment configuration, visible to anyone who can edit that environment. If you need secrets in a cloud session, add them as environment variables with that visibility in mind.

### Installed tools

Cloud sessions come with common language runtimes, build tools, and databases pre-installed. The table below summarizes what's included by category.

¹ Bun is installed but has known [proxy compatibility issues](#install-dependencies-with-a-sessionstart-hook) for package fetching.

For exact versions, ask Claude to run `check-tools` in a cloud session. This command only exists in cloud sessions.

### Work with GitHub issues and pull requests

Cloud sessions include built-in GitHub tools that let Claude read issues, list pull requests, fetch diffs, and post comments without any setup. These tools authenticate through the [GitHub proxy](#github-proxy) using whichever method you configured under [GitHub authentication options](#github-authentication-options), so your token never enters the container.

You can set `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` yourself in [environment settings](#configure-your-environment), or leave both unset and let the [GitHub proxy](#github-proxy) authenticate for you:

* If you set a token, it passes through to the container unchanged, so `gh` and your scripts use it directly.
* If you set neither, the container sets both variables to the placeholder string `proxy-injected` and the proxy substitutes your real credentials on outbound GitHub requests. `gh` works without a token of your own, but a script that reads `GITHUB_TOKEN` directly gets the placeholder, not a usable token.

To check which case applies to your session, ask Claude to run `echo $GH_TOKEN`.

The `gh` CLI isn't pre-installed. If you need a `gh` command the built-in tools don't cover, like `gh release` or `gh workflow run`, install and authenticate it yourself:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install gh in your setup script">
    Add `apt update && apt install -y gh` to your [setup script](#setup-scripts).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide a token if the proxy is not handling authentication">
    If `echo $GH_TOKEN` prints `proxy-injected`, the [GitHub proxy](#github-proxy) authenticates `gh` for you and this step is unnecessary. Otherwise, add a `GH_TOKEN` environment variable to your [environment settings](#configure-your-environment) with a GitHub personal access token. `gh` reads `GH_TOKEN` automatically, so no `gh auth login` step is needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Link output back to the session

Each cloud session has a transcript URL on claude.ai, and the session can read its own ID from the `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID` environment variable. Use this to put a traceable link in PR bodies, commit messages, Slack posts, or generated reports so a reviewer can open the run that produced them.

As of v2.1.179, commits that Claude creates in a web session include a `Claude-Session: <url>` git trailer, and PR bodies include the session URL on its own line. {/* min-version: 2.1.182 */}From v2.1.182, set [`attribution.sessionUrl`](/en/settings#attribution-settings) to `false` to omit the trailer and the PR-body link.

To include the session link in something other than a commit or PR, such as a Slack message Claude posts or a report file it writes, have Claude run the following command and use its output. The command converts the `cse_` prefix in the environment variable's value to the `session_` prefix that the transcript URL expects:

```bash theme={null}
echo "https://claude.ai/code/${CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_SESSION_ID/#cse_/session_}"
```

### Run tests, start services, and add packages

Claude runs tests as part of working on a task. Ask for it in your prompt, like "fix the failing tests in `tests/`" or "run pytest after each change." Test runners like pytest, jest, and cargo test are pre-installed and work without additional setup.

PostgreSQL and Redis are pre-installed but not running by default. Ask Claude to start each one during the session:

```bash theme={null}
service postgresql start
```

```bash theme={null}
service redis-server start
```

Docker is available for running containerized services. Ask Claude to run `docker compose up` to start your project's services. Network access to pull images follows your environment's [access level](#access-levels), and the [Trusted defaults](#default-allowed-domains) include Docker Hub and other common registries.

If your images are large or slow to pull, add `docker compose pull` or `docker compose build` to your [setup script](#setup-scripts). The pulled images are saved in the [cached environment](#environment-caching), so each new session has them on disk. The cache stores files only, not running processes, so Claude still starts the containers each session.

To add packages that aren't pre-installed, use a [setup script](#setup-scripts). The script's output is [cached](#environment-caching), so packages you install there are available at the start of every session without reinstalling each time. You can also ask Claude to install packages mid-session, but those installs don't carry over to other sessions.

### Resource limits

Cloud sessions run with approximate resource ceilings that may change over time:

* 4 vCPUs
* 16 GB of RAM
* 30 GB of disk

Tasks requiring significantly more memory, such as large build jobs or memory-intensive tests, may fail or be terminated. For workloads beyond these limits, use [Remote Control](/en/remote-control) to run Claude Code on your own hardware.

### Configure your environment

Environments control [network access](#network-access), environment variables, and the [setup script](#setup-scripts) that runs before a session starts. See [Installed tools](#installed-tools) for what's available without any configuration. You can manage environments from the web interface or the terminal:

| Action                                             | How                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add an environment                                 | Select the current environment to open the selector, then select **Add environment**. The dialog includes name, network access level, environment variables, and setup script.                                           |
| Edit an environment                                | Select the cloud icon showing the current environment's name to open the selector, hover over an environment, and click the settings icon that appears on the right.                                                     |
| Archive an environment                             | Open the environment for editing and select **Archive**. Archived environments are hidden from the selector but existing sessions keep running.                                                                          |
| Set the default environment for CLI cloud sessions | Run `/remote-env` in your terminal. If you have a single environment, this command shows your current configuration. `/remote-env` only selects the default; add, edit, and archive environments from the web interface. |

Environment variables use `.env` format with one `KEY=value` pair per line. Don't wrap values in quotes, since quotes are stored as part of the value. This example defines three variables:

```text theme={null}
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=debug
DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/myapp
```

### Organization-shared environments

Owners and admins on Team and Enterprise plans can create cloud environments that are shared with every member of the organization. Shared environments appear in each member's environment selector alongside their personal ones, so a team can standardize on one configuration instead of each member recreating it.

Manage shared environments from the **Cloud environments** page in [admin settings](https://claude.ai/admin-settings). From there you can:

* Create, edit, and archive shared environments. Each one has the same fields as a personal environment: a name, a [network access level](#access-levels), [environment variables](#configure-your-environment) in `.env` format, and a [setup script](#setup-scripts).
* Set the default environment for the organization.

Values in a shared environment reach every member's sessions in that environment. Like personal environments, shared environments have no dedicated secrets store, so don't include secrets.

Organizations in the self-hosted runners program also manage their runner pools from the same page.

## Setup scripts

A setup script is a Bash script that runs when a new cloud session starts, before Claude Code launches. Use setup scripts to install dependencies, configure tools, or fetch anything the session needs that isn't pre-installed.

Scripts run as root on Ubuntu 24.04, so `apt install` and most language package managers work.

To add a setup script, open the environment settings dialog and enter your script in the **Setup script** field.

This example installs the `gh` CLI, which isn't pre-installed:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
apt update && apt install -y gh
```

If the script exits non-zero, the session fails to start. Append `|| true` to non-critical commands to avoid blocking the session on an intermittent install failure.

Keep the script's total runtime under roughly five minutes so the [environment cache](#environment-caching) can build. Run independent installs in parallel with `&` and `wait`. If a single download won't fit in the five-minute limit, move it to a [SessionStart hook](#setup-scripts-vs-sessionstart-hooks) that launches it in the background.

<Note>
  Setup scripts that install packages need network access to reach registries. The default **Trusted** network access allows connections to [common package registries](#default-allowed-domains) including npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and crates.io. Scripts fail to install packages if your environment uses **None** network access.
</Note>

### Environment caching

The setup script runs the first time you start a session in an environment. After it completes, Anthropic snapshots the filesystem and reuses that snapshot as the starting point for later sessions. New sessions start with your dependencies, tools, and Docker images already on disk, and the setup script step is skipped. This keeps startup fast even when the script installs large toolchains or pulls container images.

The cache captures files, not running processes. Anything the setup script writes to disk carries over. Services or containers it starts don't, so start those per session by asking Claude or with a [SessionStart hook](#setup-scripts-vs-sessionstart-hooks).

The setup script runs again to rebuild the cache when you change the environment's setup script or allowed network hosts, and when the cache reaches its expiry after roughly seven days. Resuming an existing session never re-runs the setup script.

You don't need to enable caching or manage snapshots yourself.

### Setup scripts vs. SessionStart hooks

Use a setup script to install things the cloud needs but your laptop already has, like a language runtime or CLI tool. Use a [SessionStart hook](/en/hooks#sessionstart) for project setup that should run everywhere, cloud and local, like `npm install`.

Both run at the start of a session, but they belong to different places:

|               | Setup scripts                                                                                | SessionStart hooks                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attached to   | The cloud environment                                                                        | Your repository                                                |
| Configured in | Cloud environment UI                                                                         | `.claude/settings.json` in your repo                           |
| Runs          | Before Claude Code launches, when no [cached environment](#environment-caching) is available | After Claude Code launches, on every session including resumed |
| Scope         | Cloud environments only                                                                      | Both local and cloud                                           |

SessionStart hooks can also be defined in your user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` locally, but user-level settings don't carry over to cloud sessions. In the cloud, hooks come from the repo and from your organization's [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings).

### Install dependencies with a SessionStart hook

To install dependencies only in cloud sessions, add a SessionStart hook to your repo's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|resume",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/scripts/install_pkgs.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Create the script at `scripts/install_pkgs.sh`. The `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable is set to `true` in cloud sessions, so you can use it to skip local execution:

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE" != "true" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
exit 0
```

Then make the script executable:

```bash theme={null}
chmod +x scripts/install_pkgs.sh
```

SessionStart hooks have some limitations in cloud sessions:

* **No cloud-only scoping**: hooks run in both local and cloud sessions. To skip local execution, check the `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` environment variable as shown above.
* **Requires network access**: install commands need to reach package registries. If your environment uses **None** network access, these hooks fail. The [default allowlist](#default-allowed-domains) under **Trusted** covers npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and crates.io.
* **Proxy compatibility**: all outbound traffic passes through a [security proxy](#security-proxy). Some package managers don't work correctly with this proxy. Bun is a known example.
* **Adds startup latency**: hooks run each time a session starts or resumes, unlike setup scripts which benefit from [environment caching](#environment-caching). Keep install scripts fast by checking whether dependencies are already present before reinstalling.

To persist environment variables for subsequent Bash commands, write to the file at `$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`. See [SessionStart hooks](/en/hooks#sessionstart) for details.

Replacing the base image with your own Docker image is not yet supported. Use a setup script to install what you need on top of the [provided image](#installed-tools), or run your image as a container alongside Claude with `docker compose`.

## Network access

Network access controls outbound connections from the cloud environment. Each environment specifies one access level, and you can extend it with custom allowed domains. The default is **Trusted**, which allows package registries and other [allowlisted domains](#default-allowed-domains).

To change an environment's network access, [open it for editing](#configure-your-environment) and use the **Network access** selector in the dialog. There is no separate Environments page. The cloud icon appears wherever you start a cloud session or configure a [routine](/en/routines#environments-and-network-access).

<Note>
  MCP connector traffic is routed through Anthropic's servers, so the connectors you enable on a session or routine work without adding their hosts to **Allowed domains**. Connectors are configured per session or per routine; remove any you don't need to limit which tools Claude can reach. This relies on the same Anthropic-bound channel noted under [Security and isolation](#security-and-isolation).
</Note>

### Access levels

Choose an access level when you create or edit an environment:

| Level       | Outbound connections                                                                         |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **None**    | No outbound network access                                                                   |
| **Trusted** | [Allowlisted domains](#default-allowed-domains) only: package registries, GitHub, cloud SDKs |
| **Full**    | Any domain                                                                                   |
| **Custom**  | Your own allowlist, optionally including the defaults                                        |

GitHub operations use a [separate proxy](#github-proxy) that is independent of this setting.

### Allow specific domains

To allow domains that aren't in the Trusted list, select **Custom** in the environment's network access settings. An **Allowed domains** field appears. Enter one domain per line:

```text theme={null}
api.example.com
*.internal.example.com
registry.example.com
```

Use `*.` for wildcard subdomain matching. Check **Also include default list of common package managers** to keep the [Trusted domains](#default-allowed-domains) alongside your custom entries, or leave it unchecked to allow only what you list.

Allowed domains are configured per environment. There's no organization-level allowlist that Owners can push to all users' environments; [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings) can restrict cloud sessions but can't add allowed domains.

### GitHub proxy

For security, all GitHub operations go through a dedicated proxy service that keeps your real GitHub credentials outside the sandbox. The proxy authenticates two kinds of traffic:

* Git interactions: the git client inside the sandbox uses a custom-built scoped credential, which the proxy verifies and translates to your actual GitHub authentication token
* GitHub API requests: the proxy substitutes your real credentials on requests from the built-in GitHub tools, and from `gh` when your session sets the `proxy-injected` placeholder described in [Work with GitHub issues and pull requests](#work-with-github-issues-and-pull-requests)

The proxy also restricts git push operations to the current working branch for safety, and enables cloning, fetching, and PR operations while maintaining security boundaries.

The proxy limits GitHub API and release-asset requests to repositories attached to the session, regardless of the environment's [network access level](#access-levels). Setup scripts that download release assets from unattached repositories return a 403. Committed files from public repositories are fetched through `raw.githubusercontent.com`, which the [security proxy](#security-proxy) handles instead. That domain is in the default [Trusted list](#default-allowed-domains), so the files stay reachable unless the environment's [access level](#access-levels) excludes it.

### Security proxy

Environments run behind an HTTP/HTTPS network proxy for security and abuse prevention purposes. All outbound internet traffic passes through this proxy, which provides:

* Protection against malicious requests
* Rate limiting and abuse prevention
* Content filtering for enhanced security
* A DNS-level audit trail of requested hostnames

### Default allowed domains

When using **Trusted** network access, the following domains are allowed by default. Domains marked with `*` indicate wildcard subdomain matching, so `*.gcr.io` allows any subdomain of `gcr.io`.

## Move tasks between web and terminal

These workflows require the [Claude Code CLI](/en/quickstart) signed in to the same claude.ai account. You can start new cloud sessions from your terminal, or pull cloud sessions into your terminal to continue locally. Cloud sessions persist even if you close your laptop, and you can monitor them from anywhere including the Claude mobile app. The `--cloud` and `--teleport` flags don't appear in `claude --help` output, but the CLI accepts them as shown below.

<Note>
  From the CLI, session handoff is one-way: you can pull cloud sessions into your terminal with `--teleport`, but you can't push an existing terminal session to the web. The `--cloud` flag creates a new cloud session for your current repository. The [Desktop app](/en/desktop#continue-in-another-surface) provides a Continue in menu that can send a local session to the web.
</Note>

### From terminal to web

Start a cloud session from the command line with the `--cloud` flag:

```bash theme={null}
claude --cloud "Fix the authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts"
```

This creates a new cloud session on claude.ai. The session clones your current directory's GitHub remote at your current branch, so push first if you have local commits, since the VM clones from GitHub rather than your machine. `--cloud` works with a single repository at a time. The task runs in the cloud while you continue working locally. The older `--remote` spelling still works as a deprecated alias for `--cloud`.

{/* min-version: 2.1.195 */}As of v2.1.195, the CLI shows a live checklist of setup steps, such as cloning the repository and running your [setup script](#setup-scripts), while the cloud container starts. Messages you type while the container is provisioning are queued and sent once the session is ready.

<Note>
  `--cloud` creates cloud sessions. `--remote-control` is unrelated: it exposes a local CLI session for monitoring from the web. See [Remote Control](/en/remote-control).
</Note>

Use `/tasks` in the Claude Code CLI to check progress, or open the session on claude.ai or the Claude mobile app to interact directly. From there you can steer Claude, provide feedback, or answer questions just like any other conversation.

#### Tips for cloud tasks

**Plan locally, execute remotely**: for complex tasks, start Claude in plan mode to collaborate on the approach, then send work to the cloud:

```bash theme={null}
claude --permission-mode plan
```

In plan mode, Claude reads files, runs commands to explore, and proposes a plan without editing source code. Once you're satisfied, save the plan to the repo, commit, and push so the cloud VM can clone it. Then start a cloud session for autonomous execution:

```bash theme={null}
claude --cloud "Execute the migration plan in docs/migration-plan.md"
```

This pattern gives you control over the strategy while letting Claude execute autonomously in the cloud.

**Plan in the cloud with ultraplan**: to draft and review the plan itself in a web session, use [ultraplan](/en/ultraplan). Claude generates the plan on Claude Code on the web while you keep working, then you comment on sections in your browser and choose to execute remotely or send the plan back to your terminal.

**Run tasks in parallel**: each `--cloud` command creates its own cloud session that runs independently. You can start multiple tasks and they'll all run simultaneously in separate sessions:

```bash theme={null}
claude --cloud "Fix the flaky test in auth.spec.ts"
claude --cloud "Update the API documentation"
claude --cloud "Refactor the logger to use structured output"
```

Monitor all sessions with `/tasks` in the Claude Code CLI. When a session completes, you can create a PR from the web interface or [teleport](#from-web-to-terminal) the session to your terminal to continue working.

#### Send local repositories without GitHub

When you run `claude --cloud` from a repository that isn't connected to GitHub, Claude Code bundles your local repository and uploads it directly to the cloud session. The bundle includes your full repository history across all branches, plus any uncommitted changes to tracked files.

This fallback activates automatically when GitHub access isn't available. To force it even when GitHub is connected, set `CCR_FORCE_BUNDLE=1`:

```bash theme={null}
CCR_FORCE_BUNDLE=1 claude --cloud "Run the test suite and fix any failures"
```

Bundled repositories must meet these limits:

* The directory must be a git repository with at least one commit
* The bundled repository must be under 100 MB. Larger repositories fall back to bundling only the current branch, then to a single squashed snapshot of the working tree, and fail only if the snapshot is still too large
* Untracked files are not included; run `git add` on files you want the cloud session to see
* Sessions created from a bundle can't push back to a remote unless you also have [GitHub authentication](#github-authentication-options) configured

### From web to terminal

Pull a cloud session into your terminal using any of these:

* **Using `--teleport`**: from the command line, run `claude --teleport` for an interactive session picker, or `claude --teleport <session-id>` to resume a specific session directly. If you have uncommitted changes, you'll be prompted to stash them first.
* **Using `/teleport`**: inside an existing CLI session, run `/teleport` or `/tp` to open the same session picker without restarting Claude Code.
* **From `/tasks`**: run `/tasks` to see your background sessions, then press `t` to teleport into one.
* **From the web interface**: select **Open in CLI** to copy a command you can paste into your terminal.

When you teleport a session, Claude verifies you're in the correct repository, fetches and checks out the branch from the cloud session, and loads the full conversation history into your terminal.

`--teleport` is distinct from `--resume`. `--resume` reopens a conversation from this machine's local history and doesn't list cloud sessions; `--teleport` pulls a cloud session and its branch.

#### Teleport requirements

Teleport checks these requirements before resuming a session. If any requirement isn't met, you'll see an error or be prompted to resolve the issue.

| Requirement        | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clean git state    | Your working directory must have no uncommitted changes. Teleport prompts you to stash changes if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Correct repository | You must run `--teleport` from a checkout of the same repository, not a fork. {/* min-version: 2.1.199 */}As of v2.1.199, Claude Code accepts a checkout even when it can't parse the remote into a hostname, such as an SSH host alias like `git@work:owner/repo.git` or an `insteadOf`-rewritten short form. It shows a confirmation prompt first, and only when the remote's owner and repository name match the session's repository. |
| Branch available   | The branch from the cloud session must have been pushed to the remote. Teleport automatically fetches and checks it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Same account       | You must be authenticated to the same claude.ai account used in the cloud session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### `--teleport` is unavailable

Teleport requires claude.ai subscription authentication. If you're authenticated via API key, run `/login` to sign in with your claude.ai account instead. On Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry, `--teleport` stops with `Cloud sessions aren't available with <provider>` because cloud sessions run on Anthropic's infrastructure and aren't available through those providers. If you're already signed in via claude.ai and `--teleport` is still unavailable, your organization may have disabled cloud sessions.

## Work with sessions

Sessions appear in the sidebar at claude.ai/code. From there you can review changes, share with teammates, archive finished work, or delete sessions permanently.

### Manage context

Cloud sessions support [built-in commands](/en/commands) that produce text output. Commands that only run in the terminal interface, such as `/plugin` or `/resume`, aren't available. Commands that open a picker or panel in the terminal behave differently in cloud sessions:

* {/* min-version: 2.1.205 */}**`/model`, `/effort`, `/fast`, `/color`, and `/rename`**: pass the value as an argument, for example `/model sonnet`, instead of opening the terminal picker or slider. The argument forms require Claude Code v2.1.205 or later in the session's environment and follow each command's [availability notes](/en/commands#all-commands): `/effort` reports `Not applied` while a model's [launch-default effort hold](/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) is in force, and `/fast` works only in a session that started with fast mode turned on.
* **`/config`**: on the web, opens the Claude Code section of your settings instead of setting a value, and text after the command, including `key=value`, is ignored. To change settings for a cloud session, use [environment variables](#configure-your-environment) or commit [settings files](/en/settings) to the repository.

For context management specifically:

| Command    | Works in cloud sessions | Notes                                                                                                                    |
| :--------- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/compact` | Yes                     | Summarizes the conversation to free up context. Accepts optional focus instructions like `/compact keep the test output` |
| `/context` | Yes                     | Shows what's currently in the context window                                                                             |
| `/clear`   | No                      | Start a new session from the sidebar instead                                                                             |

Auto-compaction runs automatically when the context window approaches capacity. To trigger it earlier, set [`CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE`](/en/env-vars) in your [environment variables](#configure-your-environment). For example, `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=70` compacts at 70% capacity instead of waiting until the window is nearly full. To change the effective window size for compaction calculations, use [`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW`](/en/env-vars).

[Subagents](/en/sub-agents) work the same way they do locally. Claude can spawn them with the Task tool to offload research or parallel work into a separate context window, keeping the main conversation lighter. Subagents defined in your repo's `.claude/agents/` are picked up automatically.

[Agent teams](/en/agent-teams) are off by default but can be enabled by adding `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` to your [environment variables](#configure-your-environment).

### Review changes

Each session shows a diff indicator with lines added and removed, like `+42 -18`. Select it to open the diff view, leave inline comments on specific lines, and send them to Claude with your next message. See [Review and iterate](/en/web-quickstart#review-and-iterate) for the full walkthrough including PR creation. To have Claude monitor the PR for CI failures and review comments automatically, see [Auto-fix pull requests](#auto-fix-pull-requests).

### Share sessions

To share a session, toggle its visibility according to the account types below. After that, share the session link as-is. Recipients see the latest state when they open the link, but their view doesn't update in real time.

#### Share from an Enterprise or Team account

For Enterprise and Team accounts, the two visibility options are **Private** and **Team**. Team visibility makes the session visible to other members of your claude.ai organization. [Claude in Slack](/en/slack) sessions are automatically shared with Team visibility.

Repository access verification is enabled by default, based on the GitHub account connected to the recipient's account. Your account's display name is visible to all recipients with access.

#### Share from a Max or Pro account

For Max and Pro accounts, the two visibility options are **Private** and **Public**. Public visibility makes the session visible to any user logged into claude.ai.

Check your session for sensitive content before sharing. Sessions may contain code and credentials from private GitHub repositories. Repository access verification is not enabled by default.

To require recipients to have repository access, or to hide your name from shared sessions, go to Settings > Claude Code > Sharing settings.

### Archive sessions

You can archive sessions to keep your session list organized. Archived sessions are hidden from the default session list but can be viewed by filtering for archived sessions.

To archive a session, hover over the session in the sidebar and select the archive icon.

### Delete sessions

Deleting a session permanently removes the session and its data. This action can't be undone. You can delete a session in two ways:

* **From the sidebar**: filter for archived sessions, then hover over the session you want to delete and select the delete icon
* **From the session menu**: open a session, select the dropdown next to the session title, and select **Delete**

You will be asked to confirm before a session is deleted.

## Auto-fix pull requests

Claude can watch a pull request and automatically respond to CI failures and review comments. Claude subscribes to GitHub activity on the PR, and when a check fails or a reviewer leaves a comment, Claude investigates and pushes a fix if one is clear.

<Note>
  Auto-fix requires the Claude GitHub App to be installed on your repository. If you haven't already, install it from the [GitHub App page](https://github.com/apps/claude) or when prompted during [setup](/en/web-quickstart#connect-github-and-create-an-environment).
</Note>

There are a few ways to turn on auto-fix depending on where the PR came from and what device you're using:

* **PRs created in Claude Code on the web**: open the CI status bar and select **Auto-fix**
* **From your terminal**: run [`/autofix-pr`](/en/commands) while on the PR's branch. Claude Code detects the open PR with `gh`, spawns a web session, and turns on auto-fix in one step
* **From the mobile app**: tell Claude to auto-fix the PR, for example "watch this PR and fix any CI failures or review comments"
* **Any existing PR**: paste the PR URL into a session and tell Claude to auto-fix it

Auto-fix is a per-PR toggle. To stop monitoring, open the CI status bar in the web session and clear the **Auto-fix** toggle, or tell Claude to stop watching the PR.

### How Claude responds to PR activity

When auto-fix is active, Claude receives GitHub events for the PR including new review comments and CI check failures. For each event, Claude investigates and decides how to proceed:

* **Clear fixes**: if Claude is confident in a fix and it doesn't conflict with earlier instructions, Claude makes the change, pushes it, and explains what was done in the session
* **Ambiguous requests**: if a reviewer's comment could be interpreted multiple ways or involves something architecturally significant, Claude asks you before acting
* **Duplicate or no-action events**: if an event is a duplicate or requires no change, Claude notes it in the session and moves on

GitHub does not emit a webhook when the base branch advances and creates a merge conflict, so auto-fix can't react to conflicts on its own. To resolve a conflict, open the session and ask Claude to rebase.

Claude may reply to review comment threads on GitHub as part of resolving them. These replies are posted using your GitHub account, so they appear under your username, but each reply is labeled as coming from Claude Code so reviewers know it was written by the agent and not by you directly.

<Warning>
  If your repository uses comment-triggered automation such as Atlantis, Terraform Cloud, or custom GitHub Actions that run on `issue_comment` events, be aware that Claude can reply on your behalf, which can trigger those workflows. Review your repository's automation before enabling auto-fix, and consider disabling auto-fix for repositories where a PR comment can deploy infrastructure or run privileged operations.
</Warning>

## Security and isolation

Each cloud session is separated from your machine and from other sessions through several layers:

* **Isolated virtual machines**: each session runs in an isolated, Anthropic-managed VM
* **Network access controls**: network access is limited by default, and can be disabled. When running with network access disabled, Claude Code can still communicate with the Anthropic API, which may allow data to exit the VM.
* **Credential protection**: sensitive credentials such as git credentials or signing keys are never inside the sandbox with Claude Code. Authentication is handled through a secure proxy using scoped credentials.
* **Secure analysis**: code is analyzed and modified within isolated VMs before creating PRs

## Troubleshooting

For runtime API errors that appear in the conversation such as `API Error: 500`, `529 Overloaded`, `429`, or `Prompt is too long`, see the [Error reference](/en/errors). Those errors and their fixes are shared with the CLI and Desktop app. The sections below cover issues specific to cloud sessions.

### Session creation failed

If a new session fails to start with `Session creation failed` or stalls at provisioning, Claude Code could not allocate a cloud environment.

* Check [status.claude.com](https://status.claude.com) for cloud session incidents
* Retry after a minute, as capacity is provisioned on demand
* Confirm your repository is reachable. The connecting GitHub account must have access to the repository on GitHub, either through the Claude GitHub App authorization or a `gh` token synced via `/web-setup`. Installing the App on the repository isn't required. See [GitHub authentication options](#github-authentication-options).

### Unable to get organization UUID

`claude --cloud` and `claude --teleport` require sign-in with a claude.ai account. If you authenticate with an API key, or your stored account details are stale, these commands fail with `Unable to get organization UUID` or a message that API key authentication is not sufficient.

Run `/login` to sign in with your claude.ai account, then retry the command.

On Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry, the commands stop earlier with `Cloud sessions aren't available with <provider>`. Cloud sessions run on Anthropic's infrastructure and aren't available through those providers.

### Remote Control session expired or access denied

`--teleport` connects through the same Remote Control session infrastructure that cloud sessions use, so authentication and session-expiry errors surface with Remote Control wording. You may see `Remote Control session expired` or `Access denied`. The connection token is short-lived and scoped to your account.

* Run `/login` locally to refresh your credentials, then reconnect
* Confirm you are signed in to the same account that owns the session
* If you see `Remote Control may not be available for this organization`, an Owner has not enabled cloud sessions for your organization

### Environment expired

Cloud sessions stop after a period of inactivity and the underlying environment is reclaimed. From a local terminal, this surfaces as `Could not resume session ... its environment has expired. Creating a fresh session instead.` On the web, the session is marked expired in the session list.

Reopen the session from [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) to provision a fresh environment with your conversation history restored.

## Limitations

Before relying on cloud sessions for a workflow, account for these constraints:

* **Rate limits**: Claude Code on the web shares rate limits with all other Claude and Claude Code usage within your account. Running multiple tasks in parallel consumes more rate limits proportionately. There is no separate compute charge for the cloud VM.
* **Repository authentication**: you can only move sessions from web to local when you are authenticated to the same account
* **Platform restrictions**: repository cloning and pull request creation require GitHub. Self-hosted [GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/github-enterprise-server) instances are supported for Team and Enterprise plans. GitLab, Bitbucket, and other non-GitHub repositories can be sent to cloud sessions as a [local bundle](#send-local-repositories-without-github), but the session can't push results back to the remote
* **Organization IP allowlist**: cloud sessions call the Anthropic API from Anthropic-managed infrastructure, not your network. If your organization has [IP allowlisting](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13200993-restrict-access-to-claude-with-ip-allowlisting) enabled, every cloud session fails with an authentication error. The same applies to [Code Review](/en/code-review) and [Routines](/en/routines). Contact [Anthropic support](https://support.claude.com/) to exempt Anthropic-hosted services from your organization's IP allowlist.
