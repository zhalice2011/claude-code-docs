# Configure permissions

> Control how your agent uses tools with permission modes, hooks, and declarative allow/deny rules.

The Claude Agent SDK provides permission controls to manage how Claude uses tools. Use permission modes and rules to define what's allowed automatically, and the [`canUseTool` callback](/en/agent-sdk/user-input) to handle everything else at runtime.

<Note>
  This page covers permission modes and rules. To build interactive approval flows where users approve or deny tool requests at runtime, see [Handle approvals and user input](/en/agent-sdk/user-input).
</Note>

## How permissions are evaluated

When Claude requests a tool, the SDK checks permissions in this order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hooks">
    Run [hooks](/en/agent-sdk/hooks) first. A hook can deny the call outright or pass it on. A hook that returns `allow` does not skip the deny and ask rules below; those are evaluated regardless of the hook result.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deny rules">
    Check `deny` rules (from `disallowed_tools` and [settings.json](/en/settings#permission-settings)). If a deny rule matches, the tool is blocked, even in `bypassPermissions` mode. Bare-name deny rules like `Bash` remove the tool from Claude's context before this evaluation begins, so only scoped rules like `Bash(rm *)` are checked at this step.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask rules">
    Check `ask` rules from [settings.json](/en/settings#permission-settings). If an ask rule matches, the call falls through to your [`canUseTool` callback](/en/agent-sdk/user-input) for confirmation, even in `bypassPermissions` mode.

    Tools that require user interaction behave the same way: `AskUserQuestion` and MCP tools whose server sets [`_meta["anthropic/requiresUserInteraction"]`](/en/mcp#require-approval-for-a-specific-tool) always fall through to the callback, even when an allow rule matches. In `dontAsk` mode both cases are denied instead, because that mode never prompts. {/* min-version: 2.1.199 */}The MCP annotation requires Claude Code v2.1.199 or later.

    [claude.ai connector](/en/mcp#organization-controls-on-connector-tools) tools your organization has set to `ask` also leave the flow at this step. Every call falls through to the callback, even in `bypassPermissions` mode and even when an allow rule matches. The callback receives the reason `Your organization requires approval for this tool`. In `dontAsk` mode the call is denied instead, because that mode never prompts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Permission mode">
    Apply the active [permission mode](#permission-modes). `bypassPermissions` approves everything that reaches this step. `acceptEdits` approves file operations. `plan` routes file-edit and shell-write tools to your `canUseTool` callback regardless of allow rules, so write operations cannot be auto-approved while planning. Other modes fall through.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Allow rules">
    Check `allow` rules (from `allowed_tools` and settings.json). If a rule matches, the tool is approved.
  </Step>

  <Step title="canUseTool callback">
    If not resolved by any of the above, call your [`canUseTool` callback](/en/agent-sdk/user-input) for a decision. In `dontAsk` mode, this step is skipped and the tool is denied.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Hooks, deny rules, and canUseTool can route down to Blocked; permission mode bypass, allow rules, and canUseTool can route up to Execute; ask rules route to canUseTool." width="1180" height="260" data-path="images/agent-sdk/permissions-flow.svg" />

As of v2.1.198, if you pass a `canUseTool` callback that this evaluation order can never reach, the TypeScript SDK emits a Node.js process warning once when the query is constructed. The warning's code is `CLAUDE_SDK_CAN_USE_TOOL_SHADOWED`. Two configurations trigger it:

* `permissionMode: 'bypassPermissions'`, which auto-approves every call that reaches the permission mode step
* Each bare `allowedTools` entry such as `"Read"`, which auto-approves that whole tool before the callback is consulted

Entries with a specifier such as `Bash(ls *)` and the `acceptEdits` mode don't trigger it, and allow rules coming from settings files aren't visible to the check.

Listen with `process.on('warning', ...)` and match the code to log or suppress it. To gate every tool call regardless of mode and rules, use a [`PreToolUse` hook](/en/agent-sdk/hooks) instead.

This page focuses on **allow and deny rules** and **permission modes**. For the other steps:

* **Hooks:** run custom code to allow, deny, or modify tool requests. See [Control execution with hooks](/en/agent-sdk/hooks).
* **canUseTool callback:** prompt users for approval at runtime, when no earlier step resolves the call. See [Handle approvals and user input](/en/agent-sdk/user-input).

## Allow and deny rules

`allowed_tools` and `disallowed_tools` (TypeScript: `allowedTools` / `disallowedTools`) add entries to the allow and deny rule lists in the evaluation flow above. Allow rules only affect approval: a tool not listed in `allowed_tools` is still available to Claude and falls through to the permission mode. Deny rules behave differently depending on whether they name a tool or scope a pattern within one.

| Option                            | Effect                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowed_tools=["Read", "Grep"]`  | `Read` and `Grep` are auto-approved. Tools not listed here still exist and fall through to the permission mode and `canUseTool`.                                                   |
| `disallowed_tools=["Bash"]`       | The `Bash` tool definition is removed from the request. Claude does not see the tool and cannot attempt it.                                                                        |
| `disallowed_tools=["Bash(rm *)"]` | `Bash` stays available. Calls matching `rm *` are denied in every permission mode, including `bypassPermissions`. Other `Bash` calls fall through to the permission mode.          |
| `disallowed_tools=["*"]`          | Every tool definition is removed from the request. Tool-name globs are supported in deny rules: `"*"` matches every tool and `"mcp__*"` matches every MCP tool across all servers. |

Allow rules accept tool-name globs only after a literal `mcp__<server>__` prefix. The server segment must be glob-free so the rule names a specific server you configured: `mcp__puppeteer__*` matches every tool from the `puppeteer` server, and `mcp__github__get_*` matches its `get_` tools. An unanchored entry like `allowed_tools=["*"]` or `allowed_tools=["mcp__*"]` is ignored with a startup warning and does not auto-approve anything.

Scoped rules for `Read` and `Edit` take a path pattern. `Edit(path)` rules govern all built-in tools that write files, including `Write` and `NotebookEdit`; a `Write(path)` rule is never matched by the file permission checks.

Use `//path` for an absolute filesystem path: a deny rule of `Edit(//secrets/**)` blocks writes anywhere under `/secrets` on disk. With a single leading slash, `Edit(/secrets/**)` anchors at the rule's source instead. For rules passed through `allowed_tools` or `disallowed_tools`, that means the session's working directory, so the rule doesn't block `/secrets` on disk. See [Read and Edit rules](/en/permissions#read-and-edit) for the four anchor forms and how rules from settings files resolve.

<Warning>
  **Auto-approved tools never reach `canUseTool`.** A tool call approved at any earlier step, by `acceptEdits` or `bypassPermissions`, or by an allow rule, skips your `canUseTool` callback, so permission checks you put there are silently bypassed for that tool. `AskUserQuestion`, MCP tools marked [`_meta["anthropic/requiresUserInteraction"]`](/en/mcp#require-approval-for-a-specific-tool), and connector tools [your organization set to `ask`](/en/mcp#organization-controls-on-connector-tools) still reach the callback, even when an allow rule matches.

  Coverage depends on the entry's form: a bare name like `Read` or `mcp__github__get_issue` auto-approves every call to that tool, while a scoped rule like `Bash(ls *)` auto-approves only matching calls and other `Bash` calls still fall through to the callback. For checks that must run on every tool call, use a [`PreToolUse` hook](/en/agent-sdk/hooks): hooks run before every other step, and a hook deny applies even in `bypassPermissions` mode.
</Warning>

For a locked-down agent, pair `allowedTools` with `permissionMode: "dontAsk"`. Listed tools are approved, apart from the always-prompt tools in the Warning above; anything else is denied outright instead of prompting:

```typescript theme={null}
const options = {
  allowedTools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"],
  permissionMode: "dontAsk"
};
```

<Warning>
  **`allowed_tools` does not constrain `bypassPermissions`.** `allowed_tools` only pre-approves the tools you list. Unlisted tools are not matched by any allow rule and fall through to the permission mode, where `bypassPermissions` approves them. Setting `allowed_tools=["Read"]` alongside `permission_mode="bypassPermissions"` still approves every tool, including `Bash`, `Write`, and `Edit`. If you need `bypassPermissions` but want specific tools blocked, use `disallowed_tools`.
</Warning>

You can also configure allow, deny, and ask rules declaratively in `.claude/settings.json`. These rules are read when the `project` setting source is enabled, which it is for default `query()` options. If you set `setting_sources` (TypeScript: `settingSources`) explicitly, include `"project"` for them to apply. See [Permission settings](/en/settings#permission-settings) for the rule syntax.

## Permission modes

Permission modes provide global control over how Claude uses tools. You can set the permission mode when calling `query()` or change it dynamically during streaming sessions.

### Available modes

The SDK supports these permission modes:

| Mode                | Description                  | Tool behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`           | Standard permission behavior | No auto-approvals; unmatched tools trigger your `canUseTool` callback                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `dontAsk`           | Deny instead of prompting    | Anything not pre-approved by `allowed_tools` or rules is denied; connector tools [your organization set to `ask`](/en/mcp#organization-controls-on-connector-tools) and tools that require user interaction are denied even if you've pre-approved them. `canUseTool` is never called  |
| `acceptEdits`       | Auto-accept file edits       | File edits and [filesystem operations](#accept-edits-mode-acceptedits) (`mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, etc.) are automatically approved                                                                                                                                                          |
| `bypassPermissions` | Bypass permission checks     | Tools run without permission prompts, except tools matched by an explicit [`ask` rule](#how-permissions-are-evaluated), connector tools [your organization set to `ask`](/en/mcp#organization-controls-on-connector-tools), and tools that require user interaction (use with caution) |
| `plan`              | Planning mode                | Claude explores and plans without editing your source files; file edits are never auto-approved and prompt through your `canUseTool` callback                                                                                                                                          |
| `auto`              | Model-classified approvals   | A model classifier approves or denies each tool call. See [Auto mode](/en/permission-modes#eliminate-prompts-with-auto-mode) for availability                                                                                                                                          |

<Warning>
  **Subagent inheritance:** When the parent uses `bypassPermissions`, `acceptEdits`, or `auto`, all subagents inherit that mode and it cannot be overridden per subagent. Subagents may have different system prompts and less constrained behavior than your main agent, so inheriting `bypassPermissions` grants them full, autonomous system access. Explicit [`ask` rules](#how-permissions-are-evaluated), connector tools [your organization set to `ask`](/en/mcp#organization-controls-on-connector-tools), and tools that require user interaction still force a prompt.
</Warning>

### Set permission mode

You can set the permission mode once when starting a query, or change it dynamically while the session is active.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="At query time">
    Pass `permission_mode` (Python) or `permissionMode` (TypeScript) when creating a query. This mode applies for the entire session unless changed dynamically.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      import asyncio
      from claude_agent_sdk import query, ClaudeAgentOptions


      async def main():
          async for message in query(
              prompt="Help me refactor this code",
              options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
                  permission_mode="default",  # Set the mode here
              ),
          ):
              if hasattr(message, "result"):
                  print(message.result)


      asyncio.run(main())
      ```

      ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
      import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

      async function main() {
        for await (const message of query({
          prompt: "Help me refactor this code",
          options: {
            permissionMode: "default" // Set the mode here
          }
        })) {
          if ("result" in message) {
            console.log(message.result);
          }
        }
      }

      main();
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="During streaming">
    Call `set_permission_mode()` (Python) or `setPermissionMode()` (TypeScript) to change the mode mid-session. The new mode takes effect immediately for all subsequent tool requests. This lets you start restrictive and loosen permissions as trust builds, for example switching to `acceptEdits` after reviewing Claude's initial approach.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```python Python theme={null}
      import asyncio
      from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions


      async def main():
          async with ClaudeSDKClient(
              options=ClaudeAgentOptions(
                  permission_mode="default",  # Start in default mode
              )
          ) as client:
              await client.query("Help me refactor this code")

              # Change mode dynamically mid-session
              await client.set_permission_mode("acceptEdits")

              # Process messages with the new permission mode
              async for message in client.receive_response():
                  if hasattr(message, "result"):
                      print(message.result)


      asyncio.run(main())
      ```

      ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
      import { query } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

      async function main() {
        const q = query({
          prompt: "Help me refactor this code",
          options: {
            permissionMode: "default" // Start in default mode
          }
        });

        // Change mode dynamically mid-session
        await q.setPermissionMode("acceptEdits");

        // Process messages with the new permission mode
        for await (const message of q) {
          if ("result" in message) {
            console.log(message.result);
          }
        }
      }

      main();
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Mode details

#### Accept edits mode (`acceptEdits`)

Auto-approves file operations so Claude can edit code without prompting. Other tools (like Bash commands that aren't filesystem operations) still require normal permissions.

**Auto-approved operations:**

* File edits (Edit, Write tools)
* Filesystem commands: `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `mv`, `cp`, `sed`

Both apply only to paths inside the working directory or `additionalDirectories`. Paths outside that scope and writes to protected paths still prompt.

**Use when:** you trust Claude's edits and want faster iteration, such as during prototyping or when working in an isolated directory.

#### Don't ask mode (`dontAsk`)

Converts any permission prompt into a denial. Tools pre-approved by `allowed_tools`, `settings.json` allow rules, or a hook run as normal. Connector tools [your organization set to `ask`](/en/mcp#organization-controls-on-connector-tools) and tools that require user interaction are denied even when an allow rule matches. Everything else is denied without calling `canUseTool`.

**Use when:** you want a fixed, explicit tool surface for a headless agent and prefer a hard deny over silent reliance on `canUseTool` being absent.

#### Bypass permissions mode (`bypassPermissions`)

Auto-approves all tool uses without prompts. Hooks still execute and can block operations if needed.

<Warning>
  Use with extreme caution. Claude has full system access in this mode. Only use in controlled environments where you trust all possible operations.

  `allowed_tools` does not constrain this mode. Every tool is approved, not just the ones you listed. Deny rules (`disallowed_tools`), explicit `ask` rules, and hooks are evaluated before the mode check and can still block a tool. Connector tools [your organization set to `ask`](/en/mcp#organization-controls-on-connector-tools) and tools that require user interaction still fall through to your `canUseTool` callback.
</Warning>

#### Plan mode (`plan`)

Claude explores the codebase and produces a plan without editing your source files. Read-only tools run as in default mode. File edits are never auto-approved in plan mode, even when an allow rule matches. They prompt through your `canUseTool` callback instead. Claude may use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify requirements before finalizing the plan. See [Handle approvals and user input](/en/agent-sdk/user-input#handle-clarifying-questions) for handling these prompts.

**Use when:** you want Claude to propose changes without executing them, such as during code review or when you need to approve changes before they're made.
