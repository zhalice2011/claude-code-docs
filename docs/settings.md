# Claude Code settings

> Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command, which opens a tabbed Settings interface where you can view status information and modify configuration options. {/* min-version: 2.1.181 */}From v2.1.181, you can change a single option without opening the interface by passing `key=value` to `/config`, for example `/config verbose=true`.

## Configuration scopes

Claude Code uses a scope system to determine where configurations apply and who they're shared with. Understanding scopes helps you decide how to configure Claude Code for personal use, team collaboration, or enterprise deployment.

### Available scopes

| Scope       | Location                                                                           | Who it affects                                                                                                                                                          | Shared with team?                           |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Managed** | Server-managed settings, plist / registry, or system-level `managed-settings.json` | All organization members for server-managed delivery; all users on the machine for plist, HKLM registry, and file delivery; the current user for HKCU registry delivery | Yes (deployed by IT)                        |
| **User**    | `~/.claude/` directory                                                             | You, across all projects                                                                                                                                                | No                                          |
| **Project** | `.claude/` in repository                                                           | All collaborators on this repository                                                                                                                                    | Yes (committed to git)                      |
| **Local**   | `.claude/settings.local.json`                                                      | You, in this repository only                                                                                                                                            | No (gitignored when Claude Code creates it) |

### When to use each scope

**Managed scope** is for:

* Security policies that must be enforced organization-wide
* Compliance requirements that can't be overridden
* Standardized configurations deployed by IT/DevOps

**User scope** is best for:

* Personal preferences you want everywhere (themes, editor settings)
* Tools and plugins you use across all projects
* API keys and authentication (stored securely)

**Project scope** is best for:

* Team-shared settings (permissions, hooks, MCP servers)
* Plugins the whole team should have
* Standardizing tooling across collaborators

**Local scope** is best for:

* Personal overrides for a specific project
* Testing configurations before sharing with the team
* Machine-specific settings that won't work for others

### How scopes interact

When the same setting appears in multiple scopes, Claude Code applies them in priority order:

1. **Managed** (highest): can't be overridden by anything
2. **Command line arguments**: temporary session overrides
3. **Local**: overrides project and user settings
4. **Project**: overrides user settings
5. **User** (lowest): applies when nothing else specifies the setting

For example, if your user settings set `spinnerTipsEnabled` to `true` and project settings set it to `false`, the project value applies. Permission rules behave differently because they merge across scopes rather than override. See [Settings precedence](#settings-precedence).

### What uses scopes

Scopes apply to many Claude Code features:

| Feature         | User location             | Project location                   | Local location                 |
| :-------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Settings**    | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json`            | `.claude/settings.local.json`  |
| **Subagents**   | `~/.claude/agents/`       | `.claude/agents/`                  | None                           |
| **MCP servers** | `~/.claude.json`          | `.mcp.json`                        | `~/.claude.json` (per-project) |
| **Plugins**     | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `.claude/settings.json`            | `.claude/settings.local.json`  |
| **CLAUDE.md**   | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`     | `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `CLAUDE.local.md`              |

On Windows, paths shown as `~/.claude` resolve to `%USERPROFILE%\.claude`.

## Settings files

The `settings.json` file is the official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

* **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
* **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  * `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  * `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. When Claude Code creates `.claude/settings.local.json`, it configures git to ignore the file. If you create the file yourself, add it to your gitignore manually.

    Because this file is yours rather than the repository's, its permission `allow` rules take effect without the [workspace trust](/en/permissions#project-allow-rules-and-workspace-trust) step that `.claude/settings.json` allow rules require. If the repository supplies the file, for example by committing it, workspace trust still applies.
* **Managed settings**: For organizations that need centralized control, Claude Code supports multiple delivery mechanisms for managed settings. All use the same JSON format and cannot be overridden by user or project settings:

  * **Server-managed settings**: delivered remotely at sign-in, either from Anthropic's servers via the claude.ai admin console or from a self-hosted [Claude apps gateway](/en/claude-apps-gateway). See [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings).
  * **MDM/OS-level policies**: delivered through native device management on macOS and Windows:
    * macOS: `com.anthropic.claudecode` managed preferences domain. The plist's top-level keys mirror `managed-settings.json`, with nested settings as dictionaries and arrays as plist arrays. Deploy via configuration profiles in Jamf, Iru (Kandji), or similar MDM tools.
    * Windows: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\ClaudeCode` registry key with a `Settings` value (REG\_SZ or REG\_EXPAND\_SZ) containing JSON (deployed via Group Policy or Intune)
    * Windows (user-level): `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\ClaudeCode` (lowest policy priority, only used when no admin-level source exists)
  * **File-based**: `managed-settings.json` and `managed-mcp.json` deployed to system directories:

    * macOS: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`
    * Linux and WSL: `/etc/claude-code/`
    * Windows: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\`

    <Warning>
      The legacy Windows path `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json` is no longer supported as of v2.1.75. Administrators who deployed settings to that location must migrate files to `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`.
    </Warning>

    File-based managed settings also support a drop-in directory at `managed-settings.d/` in the same system directory alongside `managed-settings.json`. This lets separate teams deploy independent policy fragments without coordinating edits to a single file.

    Following the systemd convention, `managed-settings.json` is merged first as the base, then all `*.json` files in the drop-in directory are sorted alphabetically and merged on top. Later files override earlier ones for scalar values, arrays are concatenated and de-duplicated, and objects are deep-merged. Hidden files starting with `.` are ignored.

    Use numeric prefixes to control merge order, for example `10-telemetry.json` and `20-security.json`.

  See [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-only-settings) and [Managed MCP configuration](/en/managed-mcp) for details.

  This [repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/examples/mdm) includes starter deployment templates for Jamf, Iru (Kandji), Intune, and Group Policy. Use these as starting points and adjust them to fit your needs.

  <Note>
    Managed deployments can also restrict **plugin marketplace additions** using
    `strictKnownMarketplaces`. For more information, see [Managed marketplace restrictions](/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions).
  </Note>
* **Other configuration** is stored in `~/.claude.json`. This file contains your OAuth session, [MCP server](/en/mcp) configurations for user and local scopes, per-project state (allowed tools, trust settings), and various caches. Project-scoped MCP servers are stored separately in `.mcp.json`.

<Note>
  Claude Code automatically creates timestamped backups of configuration files and retains the five most recent backups to prevent data loss.
</Note>

```JSON Example settings.json theme={null}
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json",
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test *)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(curl *)",
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)"
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp"
  },
  "companyAnnouncements": [
    "Welcome to Acme Corp! Review our code guidelines at docs.acme.com",
    "Reminder: Code reviews required for all PRs",
    "New security policy in effect"
  ]
}
```

The `$schema` line in the example above points to the [official JSON schema](https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json) for Claude Code settings. Adding it to your `settings.json` enables autocomplete and inline validation in VS Code, Cursor, and any other editor that supports JSON schema validation.

The published schema is updated periodically and may not include settings added in the most recent CLI releases, so a validation warning on a recently documented field does not necessarily mean your configuration is invalid.

### When edits take effect

Claude Code watches your settings files and reloads them when they change, so edits to most keys apply to the running session without a restart. This includes `permissions`, `hooks`, and credential helpers like `apiKeyHelper`. The reload covers user, project, local, and managed settings, and the [`ConfigChange` hook](/en/hooks#configchange) fires for each detected change.

A few keys are read once at session start and apply on the next restart instead:

* `model`: use [`/model`](/en/model-config#setting-your-model) to switch mid-session
* [`outputStyle`](/en/output-styles): part of the system prompt, which is rebuilt on `/clear` or restart

### Invalid entries in managed settings

Managed settings parse tolerantly. When a managed configuration contains an entry that fails schema validation, Claude Code strips that entry, records a warning, and enforces every remaining valid policy. A single typo cannot disable the rest of your organization's policy.

This behavior is consistent across all three delivery mechanisms: [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings), plist and registry policies deployed through MDM, and `managed-settings.json` files. Requires Claude Code v2.1.169 or later.

Security-enforcement fields are handled per field instead of being stripped wholesale when they are present but invalid:

| Field                        | Behavior when present but invalid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `allowedMcpServers`          | Enforced as an empty allowlist, so no MCP servers are admitted until the value is fixed. An individual invalid entry is stripped and the valid subset is enforced.                                                                                                                    |
| `allowManagedMcpServersOnly` | Treated as `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `availableModels`            | {/* min-version: 2.1.175 */}Enforced as an empty allowlist, so only the Default model is available until the value is fixed. An individual non-string entry is stripped and the valid subset is enforced. Applies in v2.1.175 and later.                                              |
| `enforceAvailableModels`     | {/* min-version: 2.1.175 */}Treated as `true`. Applies in v2.1.175 and later.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `forceLoginOrgUUID`          | No organization is permitted to log in until the value is fixed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `deniedMcpServers`           | An individual invalid entry is stripped and the valid subset is enforced. A wholly invalid value is dropped with a warning, since denying every server would block servers the policy never named.                                                                                    |
| `sandbox.credentials`        | {/* min-version: 2.1.191 */}An individual invalid entry in `files` or `envVars` is stripped with a warning and the valid subset is enforced. A wholly invalid `credentials` value is dropped with a warning while the rest of `sandbox` still applies. Applies in v2.1.191 and later. |

`requiredMinimumVersion` and `requiredMaximumVersion` fail open by design: an invalid value is stripped rather than enforced, so a bad policy push cannot prevent Claude Code from starting.

Validation errors surface in three places:

* Interactive sessions show a dialog at startup listing the invalid entries.
* Headless runs with `-p` print a summary to stderr.
* [`claude doctor`](/en/debug-your-config) lists each invalid entry with its source and field.

Validate policy changes by running `claude doctor` on a test machine before deploying them fleet-wide.

This tolerance applies only to managed settings. User, project, and local settings files remain strict: a file that fails validation is rejected as a whole and reported.

### Available settings

`settings.json` supports a number of options:

| Key                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Example                                                                                                                         |

| `advisorModel`                    | {/* min-version: 2.1.98 */}Model for the server-side [advisor tool](/en/advisor). Accepts a model alias such as `"opus"`, `"sonnet"`, or `"fable"` ({/* min-version: 2.1.170 */}v2.1.170+), or a full model ID. Written automatically when you run `/advisor`. Unset to disable the advisor. Requires Claude Code v2.1.98 or later                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `"opus"`                                                                                                                        |

| `autoMemoryDirectory`             | Custom directory for [auto memory](/en/memory#storage-location) storage. Accepts an absolute path or a `~/`-prefixed path. From project or local settings, this is honored only after you accept the workspace trust dialog, since a cloned repository can supply this file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `"~/my-memory-dir"`                                                                                                             |
| `autoMemoryEnabled`               | **Default**: `true`. Enable [auto memory](/en/memory#enable-or-disable-auto-memory). When `false`, Claude does not read from or write to the auto memory directory. You can also toggle this with `/memory` during a session. To disable via environment variable, set [`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY`](/en/env-vars) in `env`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `false`                                                                                                                         |
| `autoMode`                        | Customize what the [auto mode](/en/permission-modes#eliminate-prompts-with-auto-mode) classifier blocks and allows. Contains `environment`, `allow`, `soft_deny`, and `hard_deny` arrays of prose rules. Include the literal string `"$defaults"` in an array to inherit the built-in rules at that position. See [Configure auto mode](/en/auto-mode-config).

| `autoMode.classifyAllShell`       | {/* min-version: 2.1.193 */}**Default**: `false`. When `true`, suspends every Bash and PowerShell allow rule while auto mode is active so all shell commands route through the classifier, not only rules that match arbitrary-code-execution patterns. See [Route all shell commands through the classifier](/en/auto-mode-config#route-all-shell-commands-through-the-classifier).

| `autoUpdatesChannel`              | **Default**: `"latest"`. Release channel to follow for updates. Use `"stable"` for a version that is typically about one week old and skips versions with major regressions, or `"latest"` for the most recent release. To disable auto-updates entirely, set [`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`](/en/setup#disable-auto-updates) in `env`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `"stable"`                                                                                                                      |

| `disableAutoMode`                 | Set to `"disable"` to prevent [auto mode](/en/permission-modes#eliminate-prompts-with-auto-mode) from being activated. Removes `auto` from the `Shift+Tab` cycle and rejects `--permission-mode auto` at startup. Most useful in [managed settings](/en/permissions#managed-settings) where users cannot override it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `"disable"`                                                                                                                     |
| `disableBundledSkills`            | Set to `true` to disable the [skills](/en/skills) and workflows that ship with Claude Code: bundled skills and workflows are removed entirely, while built-in slash commands like `/init` stay typable but are hidden from the model. Skills from plugins, `.claude/skills/`, and `.claude/commands/` are unaffected.

| `disableClaudeAiConnectors`       | {/* min-version: 2.1.182 */}Disable [claude.ai MCP connectors](/en/mcp#use-mcp-servers-from-claude-ai) so they are not auto-fetched or connected. Set in any settings scope. `true` in any source takes precedence, so a checked-in project `.claude/settings.json` can opt a repo out of cloud connectors, but a project-level `false` cannot override a user- or policy-level `true`. Servers passed explicitly via `--mcp-config` are unaffected. To deny individual connectors instead of all of them, use [`deniedMcpServers`](/en/managed-mcp).

| `disableSideloadFlags`            | {/* min-version: 2.1.193 */}(Managed settings only) Reject the `--plugin-dir`, `--plugin-url`, `--agents`, and `--mcp-config` CLI flags at startup, which users could otherwise pass to bypass [`strictKnownMarketplaces`](#strictknownmarketplaces) for a single run. Also rejects these flags from any surface that spawns the CLI with them internally, currently [Cowork](/en/desktop) local sessions in the desktop app. A `--mcp-config` whose servers are all in-process `type: "sdk"` entries is still accepted, so the Agent SDK and VS Code extension keep working. Doesn't block `claude mcp add`, `.mcp.json`, or SDK `setMcpServers()`; pair with [`allowedMcpServers`](/en/managed-mcp) for per-server MCP control.

| `forceLoginMethod`                | Use `claudeai` to restrict login to Claude.ai accounts, `console` to restrict login to Claude Console accounts, or `gateway` to restrict login to a cloud gateway; see [Claude apps gateway](/en/claude-apps-gateway). When set to any value in managed settings, sessions authenticated by `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, or `apiKeyHelper` are blocked at startup, since an environment credential cannot satisfy the required login method. Third-party provider sessions such as Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry are not blocked: they authenticate against your cloud provider rather than Anthropic                                                                                                                                                                                      | `claudeai`                                                                                                                      |
| `forceLoginGatewayUrl`            | Pre-fills and locks the gateway URL on the `/login` Cloud gateway screen. Either this key or `forceLoginMethod: "gateway"` surfaces that screen; set both so the URL is filled in. Honored only at the managed policy tier; ignored in user and project settings.

| `forceLoginOrgUUID`               | Require login to belong to a specific Anthropic organization. Accepts a single UUID string, which also pre-selects that organization during login, or an array of UUIDs where any listed organization is accepted without pre-selection. When set in managed settings, login fails if the authenticated account does not belong to a listed organization, and sessions authenticated by `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, or `apiKeyHelper` are blocked at startup since organization membership cannot be verified for them. Third-party provider sessions such as Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, and Microsoft Foundry are not blocked: use your cloud IAM to restrict which cloud accounts can be used. An empty array fails closed and blocks login with a misconfiguration message                                | `"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"` or `["xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx", "yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy"]`  |
| `forceRemoteSettingsRefresh`      | (Managed settings only) Block CLI startup until remote managed settings are freshly fetched from the server. If the fetch fails, the CLI exits rather than continuing with cached or no settings. When not set, startup continues without waiting for remote settings.

Requires Claude Code v2.1.119 or later                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `true`                                                                                                                          |
| `language`                        | Configure Claude's preferred response language (e.g., `"japanese"`, `"spanish"`, `"french"`). Claude will respond in this language by default. Also sets the language for [voice dictation](/en/voice-dictation#change-the-dictation-language) and auto-generated session titles. {/* min-version: 2.1.176 */}As of v2.1.176, when not set, session titles match the language of your conversation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `"japanese"`                                                                                                                    |
| `minimumVersion`                  | Floor that prevents background auto-updates and `claude update` from installing a version below this one. Switching from the `"latest"` channel to `"stable"` via `/config` prompts you to stay on the current version or allow the downgrade. Choosing to stay sets this value.

| `pluginSuggestionMarketplaces`    | (Managed settings only) Marketplace names whose plugins can appear as contextual install suggestions. No marketplace-declared suggestions surface without this allowlist; the built-in first-party frontend-design tip is unaffected. Suggestions come from each plugin's `relevance` declaration in its marketplace entry. A name only takes effect when the marketplace is registered on the machine and its registered source is also declared in managed settings, either as the `extraKnownMarketplaces` entry for that name or as an entry of `strictKnownMarketplaces`. A marketplace registered from a different source under an allowlisted name is ignored.

This setting has no effect in non-interactive mode (`-p`), the Agent SDK, or IDE extensions such as VS Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `true`                                                                                                                          |
| `showTurnDuration`                | **Default**: `true`. Show turn duration messages after responses, e.g. "Cooked for 1m 6s".

| `skillListingBudgetFraction`      | {/* min-version: 2.1.105 */}**Default**: `0.01` (1%). Fraction of the model's context window reserved for the [skill listing](/en/skills#skill-descriptions-are-cut-short) Claude sees each turn. When the listing exceeds the budget, descriptions for the least-used skills are collapsed to bare names so Claude can still invoke them but won't see why. Raise to keep more descriptions visible at the cost of more context per turn. `/doctor` shows the current truncation count and which skills are affected.

| `skillListingMaxDescChars`        | {/* min-version: 2.1.105 */}**Default**: `1536`. Per-skill character cap on the combined `description` and `when_to_use` text in the [skill listing](/en/skills#skill-descriptions-are-cut-short) Claude sees each turn. Text longer than this is truncated. Raise to keep long descriptions intact at the cost of more context per turn; lower to fit more skills under [`skillListingBudgetFraction`](#available-settings).

| `wslInheritsWindowsSettings`      | (Windows managed settings only) When `true`, Claude Code on WSL reads managed settings from the Windows policy chain in addition to `/etc/claude-code`, with Windows sources taking priority. Only honored when set in the HKLM registry key or `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`, both of which require Windows admin to write. For HKCU policy to also apply on WSL, the flag must additionally be set in HKCU itself.

### Global config settings

These settings are stored in `~/.claude.json` rather than `settings.json`. Adding them to `settings.json` will trigger a schema validation error.

<Note>
  Versions before v2.1.119 also store a number of `/config` preference keys here instead of in `settings.json`, including `theme`, `verbose`, `editorMode`, `autoCompactEnabled`, and `preferredNotifChannel`.

| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| `autoConnectIde`          | **Default**: `false`. Automatically connect to a running IDE when Claude Code starts from an external terminal. Appears in `/config` as **Auto-connect to IDE (external terminal)** when running outside a VS Code or JetBrains terminal. The [`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_CONNECT_IDE`](/en/env-vars) environment variable overrides this when set | `true`     |
| `autoInstallIdeExtension` | **Default**: `true`. Automatically install the Claude Code IDE extension when running from a VS Code terminal. Appears in `/config` as **Auto-install IDE extension** when running inside a VS Code or JetBrains terminal. You can also set the [`CLAUDE_CODE_IDE_SKIP_AUTO_INSTALL`](/en/env-vars) environment variable to `1`           | `false`    |
| `externalEditorContext`   | **Default**: `false`. Prepend Claude's previous response as `#`-commented context when you open the external editor with `Ctrl+G`. Appears in `/config` as **Show last response in external editor**                                                                                                                                      | `true`     |
| `teammateDefaultModel`    | Default model for [agent team](/en/agent-teams) teammates when the spawn prompt doesn't specify one. Set to a model alias such as `"sonnet"`, or `null` to inherit the lead's current `/model` selection. Appears in `/config` as **Default teammate model**                                                                              | `"sonnet"` |

### Worktree settings

Configure how `--worktree` creates and manages git worktrees.

| Key                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Example                               |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `worktree.baseRef`            | Which ref new worktrees branch from. `"fresh"` (default) branches from `origin/<default-branch>` for a clean tree matching the remote. `"head"` branches from your current local `HEAD`, so unpushed commits and feature-branch state are present in the worktree. Applies to `--worktree`, the `EnterWorktree` tool, and subagent isolation | `"head"`                              |
| `worktree.symlinkDirectories` | Directories to symlink from the main repository into each worktree to avoid duplicating large directories on disk. No directories are symlinked by default                                                                                                                                                                                   | `["node_modules", ".cache"]`          |
| `worktree.sparsePaths`        | Directories to check out in each worktree via git sparse-checkout. Only the listed directories plus root-level files are written to disk, which is faster in large monorepos                                                                                                                                                                 | `["packages/my-app", "shared/utils"]` |
| `worktree.bgIsolation`        | {/* min-version: 2.1.143 */}Isolation mode for [background sessions](/en/agent-view#how-file-edits-are-isolated). `"worktree"` (default) blocks `Edit`/`Write` in the main checkout until `EnterWorktree` is called. `"none"` lets background jobs edit the working copy directly. Requires Claude Code v2.1.143 or later                    | `"none"`                              |

To copy gitignored files like `.env` into new worktrees, use a [`.worktreeinclude` file](/en/worktrees#copy-gitignored-files-into-worktrees) in your project root instead of a setting.

Valid values: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `auto`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, and {/* min-version: 2.1.200 */}`manual` as an alias for `default`, the mode labeled Manual in the CLI and the VS Code and JetBrains extensions. The `manual` alias requires Claude Code v2.1.200 or later. {/* min-version: 2.1.142 */}`auto` is ignored when set in project or local settings, so a repository can't grant itself auto mode; set it in `~/.claude/settings.json` instead. Before v2.1.142, project settings could set `auto`. The `--permission-mode` CLI flag overrides this setting for a single session | `"acceptEdits"`                                                        |

### Permission rule syntax

Permission rules follow the format `Tool` or `Tool(specifier)`. Rules are evaluated in order: deny rules first, then ask, then allow. The first match determines the outcome regardless of rule specificity. See the [permission rule evaluation order](/en/permissions#manage-permissions) for details.

Quick examples:

| Rule                           | Effect                                   |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `Bash`                         | Matches all Bash commands                |
| `Bash(npm run *)`              | Matches commands starting with `npm run` |
| `Read(./.env)`                 | Matches reading the `.env` file          |
| `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` | Matches fetch requests to example.com    |

For the complete rule syntax reference, including wildcard behavior, tool-specific patterns for Read, Edit, WebFetch, MCP, and Agent rules, and security limitations of Bash patterns, see [Permission rule syntax](/en/permissions#permission-rule-syntax).

### Sandbox settings

Configure advanced sandboxing behavior. Sandboxing isolates bash commands from your filesystem and network. See [Sandboxing](/en/sandboxing) for details.

| `credentials.files`                    | {/* min-version: 2.1.187 */}Credential files or directories that sandboxed commands cannot read. Applies the same read block as `filesystem.denyRead`; the separate key keeps credential paths grouped with `credentials.envVars` and apart from general filesystem rules.

#### Sandbox path prefixes

Paths in `filesystem.allowWrite`, `filesystem.denyWrite`, `filesystem.denyRead`, `filesystem.allowRead`, and `credentials.files` support these prefixes:

| Prefix            | Meaning                                                                                | Example                                                                   |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/`               | Absolute path from filesystem root                                                     | `/tmp/build` stays `/tmp/build`                                           |
| `~/`              | Relative to home directory                                                             | `~/.kube` becomes `$HOME/.kube`                                           |
| `./` or no prefix | Relative to the project root for project settings, or to `~/.claude` for user settings | `./output` in `.claude/settings.json` resolves to `<project-root>/output` |

The older `//path` prefix for absolute paths still works. If you previously used single-slash `/path` expecting project-relative resolution, switch to `./path`.

This syntax differs from [Read and Edit permission rules](/en/permissions#read-and-edit), which use `//path` for absolute and `/path` for project-relative. Sandbox filesystem paths use standard conventions: `/tmp/build` is an absolute path.

**Configuration example:**

```json theme={null}
{
  "sandbox": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": true,
    "excludedCommands": ["docker *"],
    "filesystem": {
      "allowWrite": ["/tmp/build", "~/.kube"],
      "denyRead": ["~/.aws/credentials"]
    },
    "network": {
      "allowedDomains": ["github.com", "*.npmjs.org", "registry.yarnpkg.com"],
      "deniedDomains": ["uploads.github.com"],
      "allowUnixSockets": [
        "/var/run/docker.sock"
      ],
      "allowLocalBinding": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Filesystem and network restrictions** can be configured in two ways that are merged together:

* **`sandbox.filesystem` settings** (shown above): Control paths at the OS-level sandbox boundary. These restrictions apply to all subprocess commands (e.g., `kubectl`, `terraform`, `npm`), not just Claude's file tools.
* **Permission rules**: Use `Edit` allow/deny rules to control Claude's file tool access, `Read` deny rules to block reads, and `WebFetch` allow/deny rules to control network domains. Paths from these rules are also merged into the sandbox configuration.

### Attribution settings

Claude Code adds attribution to git commits and pull requests. These are configured separately:

* Commits use [git trailers](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers) (like `Co-Authored-By`) by default,  which can be customized or disabled
* Pull request descriptions are plain text

| Keys         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commit`     | Attribution for git commits, including any trailers. Empty string hides commit attribution                                                                                                                                           |
| `pr`         | Attribution for pull request descriptions. Empty string hides pull request attribution                                                                                                                                               |
| `sessionUrl` | Whether to append the claude.ai session link as a `Claude-Session` trailer on commits and a link in pull request descriptions when running from a web or Remote Control session. Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` to omit the link |

**Default commit attribution:**

```text theme={null}
Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

The model name in the trailer reflects the active model for the session.

**Default pull request attribution:**

```text theme={null}
🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

**Example:**

```json theme={null}
{
  "attribution": {
    "commit": "Generated with AI\n\nCo-Authored-By: AI <ai@example.com>",
    "pr": ""
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The `attribution` setting takes precedence over the deprecated `includeCoAuthoredBy` setting. To hide all attribution, set `commit` and `pr` to empty strings and `sessionUrl` to `false`.
</Note>

### File suggestion settings

Configure a custom command for `@` file path autocomplete. The built-in file suggestion uses fast filesystem traversal, but large monorepos may benefit from project-specific indexing such as a pre-built file index or custom tooling.

```json theme={null}
{
  "fileSuggestion": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/file-suggestion.sh"
  }
}
```

The command runs with the same environment variables as [hooks](/en/hooks), including `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`. It receives JSON via stdin with a `query` field:

```json theme={null}
{"query": "src/comp"}
```

Output newline-separated file paths to stdout (currently limited to 15):

```text theme={null}
src/components/Button.tsx
src/components/Modal.tsx
src/components/Form.tsx
```

**Example:**

```bash theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
query=$(cat | jq -r '.query')
# Replace your-repo-file-index with your own file search command
your-repo-file-index --query "$query" | head -20
```

### Footer link badges

The `footerLinksRegexes` setting renders extra clickable badges in the footer below the input box. Use it to turn IDs printed by project CLIs, such as review tools and issue trackers, into session links.

Each entry's `pattern` regex is matched against turn output: tool results, including file contents and fetched pages, and Claude's own responses. `{name}` placeholders in `url` and `label` are filled from named capture groups in the pattern.

The following example renders a badge whenever an issue key like `PROJ-1234` appears in turn output. The `(?<key>...)` named group captures the key, and `{key}` substitutes it into the URL and label:

```json ~/.claude/settings.json theme={null}
{
  "footerLinksRegexes": [
    {
      "type": "regex",
      "pattern": "\\b(?<key>PROJ-\\d+)\\b",
      "url": "https://issues.example.com/browse/{key}",
      "label": "{key}"
    }
  ]
}
```

With this configured, when `PROJ-1234` appears in a tool result or in Claude's reply, a `PROJ-1234` badge appears in the footer linking to `https://issues.example.com/browse/PROJ-1234`.

The following constraints apply to each entry:

| Constraint     | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| URL origin     | Captured values are URL-encoded and the constructed URL must share the template's literal origin. A capture can fill a path segment or query value but cannot change where the link points         |
| URL length     | Constructed URLs longer than 2048 characters are dropped                                                                                                                                           |
| URL scheme     | Must be `https`, `http`, or a recognized editor or workspace deep-link scheme: `vscode`, `vscode-insiders`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `zed`, `jetbrains`, `idea`, `slack`, `linear`, `notion`, `figma` |
| Label          | Defaults to the matched text and is truncated to 28 display columns                                                                                                                                |
| Badge count    | At most 5 badges render. The oldest is displaced by newer matches and `/clear` removes them                                                                                                        |
| Settings scope | Read from user settings, the `--settings` flag, and managed settings only. Ignored in project `.claude/settings.json` and local `.claude/settings.local.json`                                      |

When a turn completes, Claude Code matches each entry's `pattern` regex against the turn output on the main thread, so a slow regex blocks the UI until it finishes. Nested quantifiers such as `(a+)+$` can take exponentially long against certain inputs and freeze the session, so keep each `pattern` linear and avoid nesting `+` or `*`.

Footer badges render alongside a [custom status line](/en/statusline) when one is configured; neither replaces the other. Use a status line for a script-driven row that computes its own content from session data, and footer badges to turn IDs from the conversation into links without a script.

### Hook configuration

These settings control which hooks are allowed to run and what HTTP hooks can access. The `allowManagedHooksOnly` setting can only be configured in [managed settings](#settings-files). The URL and env var allowlists can be set at any settings level and merge across sources.

**Behavior when `allowManagedHooksOnly` is `true`:**

* Managed hooks and SDK hooks are loaded
* Hooks from plugins force-enabled in managed settings `enabledPlugins` are loaded. This lets administrators distribute vetted hooks through an organization marketplace while blocking everything else. Trust is granted by full `plugin@marketplace` ID, so a plugin with the same name from a different marketplace stays blocked
* User hooks, project hooks, and all other plugin hooks are blocked

**Restrict HTTP hook URLs:**

Limit which URLs HTTP hooks can target. Supports `*` as a wildcard for matching. When the array is defined, HTTP hooks targeting non-matching URLs are silently blocked. Hostname matching is case-insensitive and ignores a trailing FQDN dot, matching DNS semantics.

```json theme={null}
{
  "allowedHttpHookUrls": ["https://hooks.example.com/*", "http://localhost:*"]
}
```

**Restrict HTTP hook environment variables:**

Limit which environment variable names HTTP hooks can interpolate into header values. Each hook's effective `allowedEnvVars` is the intersection of its own list and this setting.

```json theme={null}
{
  "httpHookAllowedEnvVars": ["MY_TOKEN", "HOOK_SECRET"]
}
```

### Compute managed settings with a policy helper

The `policyHelper` setting points at an executable that computes managed settings at startup, so admins can derive policy from device posture, identity, or a remote service instead of a static file. Configure it from MDM or a system `managed-settings.json` file. Claude Code ignores `policyHelper` when it appears in any other scope, including user settings, project settings, the HKCU registry hive, and [server-managed settings](/en/server-managed-settings).

The setting accepts these keys:

| Key                 | Type   | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`              | string | Absolute path to the helper executable                                                                  |
| `timeoutMs`         | number | How long to wait for the helper before treating the run as failed                                       |
| `refreshIntervalMs` | number | How often to re-run the helper in the background. Set to `0` to disable refresh, or to at least `60000` |

The helper writes a JSON envelope to stdout. Put the settings under a `managedSettings` key rather than at the top level, since a bare settings object parses with `managedSettings` undefined and applies nothing:

```json theme={null}
{
  "managedSettings": {
    "permissions": { "deny": ["Read(//etc/secrets/**)"] }
  },
  "claudeMd": "# Organization context\n...",
  "appendSystemPrompt": "Always cite the internal style guide."
}
```

When the helper emits `managedSettings`, that object becomes the only managed settings source for the run, taking precedence over remote, MDM, and file-based sources. When the helper exits non-zero at startup, Claude Code prints the error and refuses to start, so a helper that needs outage resilience should serve from its own cache and exit `0`.

### Settings precedence

Settings apply in order of precedence. From highest to lowest:

1. **Managed settings** ([server-managed](/en/server-managed-settings), [MDM/OS-level policies](#configuration-scopes), or [managed settings](/en/settings#settings-files))
   * Policies deployed by IT through server delivery, MDM configuration profiles, registry policies, or managed settings files
   * Cannot be overridden by any other level, including command line arguments
   * Within the managed tier, only one source is used and the others are ignored rather than merged. Precedence, highest first:
     * [`policyHelper`](#compute-managed-settings-with-a-policy-helper) output: when configured, this is the only managed source used
     * Remote (claude.ai [server-managed](/en/server-managed-settings) or [Claude apps gateway](/en/claude-apps-gateway)-delivered)
     * MDM/OS-level policies
     * File-based (`managed-settings.d/*.json` and `managed-settings.json`, merged together)
     * HKCU registry (Windows only)
   * A few keys are exceptions, honored when any admin-controlled managed source sets them rather than only the winning source. The user-writable HKCU registry source is excluded. The exception keys are:
     * the sandbox lock keys `sandbox.network.allowManagedDomainsOnly` and `sandbox.filesystem.allowManagedReadPathsOnly`, with their associated allowlists
     * `allowAllClaudeAiMcps`
     * the sandbox binary paths `sandbox.bwrapPath` and `sandbox.socatPath`
     * [`forceRemoteSettingsRefresh`](/en/server-managed-settings)
   * Embedding hosts such as Claude Desktop can supply policy via the SDK `managedSettings` option. By default this is ignored when an admin-deployed managed source is present: server-managed settings, an MDM or OS-level policy, or a managed settings file. The user-writable HKCU registry fallback does not count as an admin-deployed source. Administrators can opt in by setting [`parentSettingsBehavior`](#available-settings) to `"merge"`. The embedder's values are filtered so they can tighten managed policy but not loosen it.

2. **Command line arguments**
   * Temporary overrides for a specific session. JSON passed via `--settings <file-or-json>` merges with file-based settings using the same rules as the other layers: a key set here overrides the same key in local, project, or user settings, and omitting a key leaves the lower-layer value in place

3. **Local project settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
   * Personal project-specific settings

4. **Shared project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`)
   * Team-shared project settings in source control

5. **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`)
   * Personal global settings

This hierarchy ensures that organizational policies are always enforced while still allowing teams and individuals to customize their experience. The same precedence applies whether you run Claude Code from the CLI, the [VS Code extension](/en/vs-code), or a [JetBrains IDE](/en/jetbrains).

For example, if your user settings set `permissions.defaultMode` to `acceptEdits` and a project's shared settings set it to `default`, the project value applies. The example below covers how array-valued settings such as permission rules combine instead.

<Note>
  **Array settings merge across scopes.** When the same array-valued setting (such as `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` or `permissions.allow`) appears in multiple scopes, the arrays are **concatenated and deduplicated**, not replaced. This means lower-priority scopes can add entries without overriding those set by higher-priority scopes, and vice versa. For example, if managed settings set `allowWrite` to `["/opt/company-tools"]` and a user adds `["~/.kube"]`, both paths are included in the final configuration.

  Two array settings do not merge this way:

  * [`fallbackModel`](#available-settings) is an ordered chain where position carries meaning: the highest-precedence file that defines it supplies the entire value.
  * [`availableModels`](#available-settings): {/* min-version: 2.1.175 */}when the [highest-precedence managed source](/en/server-managed-settings#settings-precedence) defines it, that list applies as-is and user, project, and local entries cannot extend it. Across non-managed scopes the arrays merge as usual. See [Merge behavior](/en/model-config#merge-behavior).
</Note>

### Verify active settings

Run `/status` inside Claude Code to see which settings sources are active. Inside the menu, the **Status** tab includes a `Setting sources` line that lists each layer Claude Code loaded for the current session, such as `User settings` or `Project local settings`. When [managed settings](/en/admin-setup#decide-how-settings-reach-devices) are in effect, the entry shows the delivery channel in parentheses, for example `Enterprise managed settings (remote)`, `(plist)`, `(HKLM)`, `(HKCU)`, or `(file)`. The `remote` channel covers both claude.ai server-managed settings and [Claude apps gateway](/en/claude-apps-gateway)-delivered policies. A layer appears in the list only when that source is loaded with at least one key, so an empty list means no settings sources were found.

The `Setting sources` line confirms which sources are being read. It does not show which layer supplied each individual key. The **Config** tab in the same dialog is an editor for a fixed set of toggles such as theme and verbose output, not a view of your `settings.json` contents.

If a settings file contains errors, such as invalid JSON or a value that fails validation, `/status` lists the affected files. Run `/doctor` to see the details for each error.

### Key points about the configuration system

* **Memory files (`CLAUDE.md`)**: Contain instructions and context that Claude loads at startup
* **Settings files (JSON)**: Configure permissions, environment variables, and tool behavior
* **Skills**: Custom prompts that can be invoked with `/skill-name` or loaded by Claude automatically
* **MCP servers**: Extend Claude Code with additional tools and integrations
* **Precedence**: Higher-level configurations (Managed) override lower-level ones (User/Project)
* **Inheritance**: Settings merge across scopes; scalar values from higher-priority scopes override, and arrays concatenate, with two exceptions described in the [array-merge Note](#settings-precedence)

### System prompt

Claude Code's internal system prompt is not published. To add custom instructions, use `CLAUDE.md` files or the `--append-system-prompt` flag.

### Exclude sensitive files

To prevent Claude Code from accessing files containing sensitive information like API keys, secrets, and environment files, use the `permissions.deny` setting in your `.claude/settings.json` file:

```json theme={null}
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env)",
      "Read(./.env.*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Read(./config/credentials.json)",
      "Read(./build)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This replaces the deprecated `ignorePatterns` configuration. Files matching these patterns are excluded from file discovery and search results, and read operations on these files are denied.

## Subagent configuration

Claude Code supports custom AI subagents that can be configured at both user and project levels. These subagents are stored as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

* **User subagents**: `~/.claude/agents/`, available across all your projects
* **Project subagents**: `.claude/agents/`, specific to your project and shareable with your team

Subagent files define specialized AI assistants with custom prompts and tool permissions. Learn more about creating and using subagents in the [subagents documentation](/en/sub-agents).

## Plugin configuration

Claude Code supports a plugin system that lets you extend functionality with skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers. Plugins are distributed through marketplaces and can be configured at both user and repository levels.

### Plugin settings

Plugin-related settings in `settings.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "formatter@acme-tools": true,
    "deployer@acme-tools": true,
    "analyzer@security-plugins": false
  },
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### `enabledPlugins`

Controls which plugins are enabled. Format: `"plugin-name@marketplace-name": true/false`. A plugin with no entry at any scope falls back to its [`defaultEnabled`](/en/plugins-reference#default-enablement) value.

**Scopes**:

* **User settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json`): Personal plugin preferences
* **Project settings** (`.claude/settings.json`): Project-specific plugins shared with team
* **Local settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`): Per-machine overrides, gitignored when Claude Code creates it
* **Managed settings** (`managed-settings.json`): Organization-wide policy overrides that block installation at all scopes and hide the plugin from the marketplace

<Note>
  Project settings take precedence over user settings, so setting a plugin to `false` in `~/.claude/settings.json` does not disable a plugin that the project's `.claude/settings.json` enables. To opt out of a project-enabled plugin on your machine, set it to `false` in `.claude/settings.local.json` instead.

  Plugins force-enabled by managed settings cannot be disabled this way, since managed settings override local settings.

  Enabling a plugin from an external source such as a GitHub repository or npm package in a project's `.claude/settings.json` doesn't install it for other people. As of Claude Code v2.1.195, every path that loads plugins asks each user to [install and trust the plugin](/en/discover-plugins#configure-team-marketplaces) before it runs.
</Note>

**Example**:

```json theme={null}
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "code-formatter@team-tools": true,
    "deployment-tools@team-tools": true,
    "experimental-features@personal": false
  }
}
```

#### `extraKnownMarketplaces`

Defines additional marketplaces that should be made available for the repository. Typically used in repository-level settings to ensure team members have access to required plugin sources.

**When a repository includes `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

1. Team members are prompted to install the marketplace when they trust the folder
2. Team members are then prompted to install plugins from that marketplace
3. Users can skip unwanted marketplaces or plugins (stored in user settings)
4. Installation respects trust boundaries and requires explicit consent

**Example**:

```json theme={null}
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "acme-corp/claude-plugins"
      }
    },
    "security-plugins": {
      "source": {
        "source": "git",
        "url": "https://git.example.com/security/plugins.git"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Marketplace source types**:

* `github`: GitHub repository (uses `repo`)
* `git`: Any git URL (uses `url`)
* `directory`: Local filesystem path (uses `path`, for development only)
* `hostPattern`: regex pattern to match marketplace hosts (uses `hostPattern`)
* `settings`: inline marketplace declared directly in settings.json without a separate hosted repository (uses `name` and `plugins`)

The `git` source type works with any git hosting service, including self-hosted GitLab and Bitbucket. Claude Code clones the repository with the same authentication that `git clone` would use on that machine: configured credential helpers, SSH keys, or a host-specific token environment variable. See [Private repositories](/en/plugin-marketplaces#private-repositories) for setup details.

For `github` and `git` sources, set `"skipLfs": true` inside the `source` object (alongside `repo` or `url`) to skip Git LFS downloads when Claude Code clones or updates the marketplace repository. LFS pointer files remain as pointers instead of downloading their content. Use this when the repository contains large LFS objects unrelated to plugin content. {/* min-version: 2.1.153 */}Requires Claude Code v2.1.153 or later.

Each marketplace entry also accepts an optional `autoUpdate` Boolean. Set `"autoUpdate": true` alongside `source` to make Claude Code refresh that marketplace and update its installed plugins at startup. When omitted, official Anthropic marketplaces default to `true` and all other marketplaces default to `false`. See [Configure auto-updates](/en/discover-plugins#configure-auto-updates).

Use `source: 'settings'` to declare a small set of plugins inline without setting up a hosted marketplace repository. Plugins listed here must reference external sources such as GitHub or npm. You still need to enable each plugin separately in `enabledPlugins`.

```json theme={null}
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "team-tools": {
      "source": {
        "source": "settings",
        "name": "team-tools",
        "plugins": [
          {
            "name": "code-formatter",
            "source": {
              "source": "github",
              "repo": "acme-corp/code-formatter"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### `strictKnownMarketplaces`

**Managed settings only**: Controls which plugin marketplaces users are allowed to add and install plugins from. This setting can only be configured in [managed settings](/en/settings#settings-files) and provides administrators with strict control over marketplace sources.

**Managed settings file locations**:

* **macOS**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json`
* **Linux and WSL**: `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`
* **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\managed-settings.json`

**Key characteristics**:

* Only available in managed settings (`managed-settings.json`)
* Cannot be overridden by user or project settings (highest precedence)
* Enforced before network and filesystem operations, so blocked sources never run
* Uses exact matching for source specifications (including `ref`, `path` for git sources), except `hostPattern` and `pathPattern`, which use regex matching

**Allowlist behavior**:

* `undefined` (default): no restrictions, so users can add any marketplace
* Empty array `[]`: complete lockdown, so users can't add any new marketplaces
* List of sources: users can only add marketplaces that match exactly

**All supported source types**:

The allowlist supports multiple marketplace source types. Most sources use exact matching, while `hostPattern` and `pathPattern` use regex matching against the marketplace host and filesystem path respectively.

1. **GitHub repositories**:

```json theme={null}
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools", "ref": "v2.0" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main", "path": "marketplace" }
```

Fields: `repo` (required), `ref` (optional: branch or tag), `path` (optional: subdirectory)

2. **Git repositories**:

```json theme={null}
{ "source": "git", "url": "https://gitlab.example.com/tools/plugins.git" }
{ "source": "git", "url": "https://bitbucket.org/acme-corp/plugins.git", "ref": "production" }
{ "source": "git", "url": "ssh://git@git.example.com/plugins.git", "ref": "v3.1", "path": "approved" }
```

Fields: `url` (required), `ref` (optional: branch or tag), `path` (optional: subdirectory)

3. **URL-based marketplaces**:

```json theme={null}
{ "source": "url", "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json" }
{ "source": "url", "url": "https://cdn.example.com/marketplace.json", "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${TOKEN}" } }
```

Fields: `url` (required), `headers` (optional: HTTP headers for authenticated access)

<Note>
  URL-based marketplaces only download the `marketplace.json` file. They do not download plugin files from the server. Plugins in URL-based marketplaces must use external sources (GitHub, npm, or git URLs) rather than relative paths. For plugins with relative paths, use a Git-based marketplace instead. See [Troubleshooting](/en/plugin-marketplaces#plugins-with-relative-paths-fail-in-url-based-marketplaces) for details.
</Note>

4. **NPM packages**:

```json theme={null}
{ "source": "npm", "package": "@acme-corp/claude-plugins" }
{ "source": "npm", "package": "@acme-corp/approved-marketplace" }
```

Fields: `package` (required, supports scoped packages)

5. **File paths**:

```json theme={null}
{ "source": "file", "path": "/usr/local/share/claude/acme-marketplace.json" }
{ "source": "file", "path": "/opt/acme-corp/plugins/marketplace.json" }
```

Fields: `path` (required: absolute path to marketplace.json file)

6. **Directory paths**:

```json theme={null}
{ "source": "directory", "path": "/usr/local/share/claude/acme-plugins" }
{ "source": "directory", "path": "/opt/acme-corp/approved-marketplaces" }
```

Fields: `path` (required: absolute path to directory containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)

7. **Host pattern matching**:

```json theme={null}
{ "source": "hostPattern", "hostPattern": "^github\\.example\\.com$" }
{ "source": "hostPattern", "hostPattern": "^gitlab\\.internal\\.example\\.com$" }
```

Fields: `hostPattern` (required: regex pattern to match against the marketplace host)

Use host pattern matching when you want to allow all marketplaces from a specific host without enumerating each repository individually. This is useful for organizations with internal GitHub Enterprise or GitLab servers where developers create their own marketplaces.

Host extraction by source type:

* `github`: always matches against `github.com`
* `git`: extracts hostname from the URL (supports both HTTPS and SSH formats)
* `url`: extracts hostname from the URL
* `npm`, `file`, `directory`: not supported for host pattern matching

8. **Path pattern matching**:

```json theme={null}
{ "source": "pathPattern", "pathPattern": "^/opt/approved/" }
{ "source": "pathPattern", "pathPattern": ".*" }
```

Fields: `pathPattern` (required: regex pattern matched against the `path` field of `file` and `directory` sources)

Use path pattern matching to allow filesystem-based marketplaces alongside `hostPattern` restrictions for network sources. Set `".*"` to allow all local paths, or a narrower pattern to restrict to specific directories.

**Configuration examples**:

Example: allow specific marketplaces only:

```json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/approved-plugins"
    },
    {
      "source": "github",
      "repo": "acme-corp/security-tools",
      "ref": "v2.0"
    },
    {
      "source": "url",
      "url": "https://plugins.example.com/marketplace.json"
    },
    {
      "source": "npm",
      "package": "@acme-corp/compliance-plugins"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example: disable all marketplace additions:

```json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": []
}
```

Example: allow all marketplaces from an internal git server:

```json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    {
      "source": "hostPattern",
      "hostPattern": "^github\\.example\\.com$"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Exact matching requirements**:

Marketplace sources must match exactly for a user's addition to be allowed. For git-based sources (`github` and `git`), this includes all optional fields:

* The `repo` or `url` must match exactly
* The `ref` field must match exactly (or both be undefined)
* The `path` field must match exactly (or both be undefined)

Examples of sources that don't match:

```json theme={null}
// These are DIFFERENT sources:
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "ref": "main" }

// These are also DIFFERENT:
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins", "path": "marketplace" }
{ "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
```

**Comparison with `extraKnownMarketplaces`**:

| Aspect                | `strictKnownMarketplaces`            | `extraKnownMarketplaces`             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**           | Organizational policy enforcement    | Team convenience                     |
| **Settings file**     | `managed-settings.json` only         | Any settings file                    |
| **Behavior**          | Blocks non-allowlisted additions     | Auto-installs missing marketplaces   |
| **When enforced**     | Before network/filesystem operations | After user trust prompt              |
| **Can be overridden** | No (highest precedence)              | Yes (by higher precedence settings)  |
| **Source format**     | Direct source object                 | Named marketplace with nested source |
| **Use case**          | Compliance, security restrictions    | Onboarding, standardization          |

**Format difference**:

`strictKnownMarketplaces` uses direct source objects:

```json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
  ]
}
```

`extraKnownMarketplaces` requires named marketplaces:

```json theme={null}
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Using both together**:

`strictKnownMarketplaces` is a policy gate: it controls what users may add but does not register any marketplaces. To both restrict and pre-register a marketplace for all users, set both in `managed-settings.json`:

```json theme={null}
{
  "strictKnownMarketplaces": [
    { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
  ],
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "acme-tools": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "acme-corp/plugins" }
    }
  }
}
```

With only `strictKnownMarketplaces` set, users can still add the allowed marketplace manually via `/plugin marketplace add`, but it is not available automatically.

**Important notes**:

* Restrictions are checked before any network requests or filesystem operations
* When blocked, users see clear error messages indicating the source is blocked by managed policy
* The restriction is enforced on marketplace add and on plugin install, update, refresh, and auto-update. A marketplace added before the policy was set cannot be used to install or update plugins once its source no longer matches the allowlist
* Managed settings have the highest precedence and cannot be overridden

See [Managed marketplace restrictions](/en/plugin-marketplaces#managed-marketplace-restrictions) for user-facing documentation.

#### `strictPluginOnlyCustomization`

**Managed settings only**: blocks skills, agents, hooks, and MCP servers from user and project sources, so they can only come from plugins or managed settings. Combine it with `strictKnownMarketplaces` to control the full customization supply chain: the marketplace allowlist controls which plugins users can install, and this setting blocks everything that doesn't come from a plugin or from managed settings.

<Note>
  `strictPluginOnlyCustomization` requires Claude Code v2.1.82 or later. Earlier versions ignore the key and keep loading user and project customizations, so the lockdown isn't enforced until clients update.
</Note>

The value is either `true` to lock all four surfaces, or an array naming the surfaces to lock:

```json theme={null}
{
  "strictPluginOnlyCustomization": ["skills", "hooks"]
}
```

For each locked surface, Claude Code skips user-level and project-level sources and loads only plugin-provided and managed sources:

| Surface  | Blocked when locked                               | Still loads                                                            |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `skills` | `~/.claude/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`            | Plugin skills, bundled skills, skills in the managed policy directory  |
| `agents` | `~/.claude/agents/`, `.claude/agents/`            | Plugin agents, built-in agents, agents in the managed policy directory |
| `hooks`  | Hooks in user, project, and local `settings.json` | Plugin hooks, hooks in managed settings                                |
| `mcp`    | Servers in `~/.claude.json` and `.mcp.json`       | Plugin MCP servers, [`managed-mcp.json`](/en/managed-mcp) servers      |

Surface names that a Claude Code version doesn't recognize are ignored rather than failing the settings file, so you can add new surface names before all clients have updated.

### Manage plugins

Use the `/plugin` command to manage plugins interactively:

* Browse available plugins from marketplaces
* Install/uninstall plugins
* Enable/disable plugins
* View plugin details (skills, agents, hooks provided)
* Add/remove marketplaces

Learn more about the plugin system in the [plugins documentation](/en/plugins).

## Environment variables

Environment variables let you control Claude Code behavior without editing settings files. Any variable can also be configured in [`settings.json`](#available-settings) under the `env` key to apply it to every session or roll it out to your team.

See the [environment variables reference](/en/env-vars) for the full list.

## Tools available to Claude

Claude Code has access to a set of tools for reading, editing, searching, running commands, and orchestrating subagents. Tool names are the exact strings you use in permission rules and hook matchers.

See the [tools reference](/en/tools-reference) for the full list and Bash tool behavior details.
