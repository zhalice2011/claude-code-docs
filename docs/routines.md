# Automate work with routines

> Put Claude Code on autopilot. Define routines that run on a schedule, trigger on API calls, or react to GitHub events from Anthropic-managed cloud infrastructure.

<Note>
  Routines are in research preview. Behavior, limits, and the API surface may change.
</Note>

A routine is a saved Claude Code configuration: a prompt, one or more repositories, and a set of [connectors](/docs/en/mcp), packaged once and run automatically. Routines execute on Anthropic-managed cloud infrastructure, so they keep working when your laptop is closed.

Each routine can have one or more triggers attached to it:

* **Scheduled**: run on a recurring cadence like hourly, nightly, or weekly, or once at a specific future time
* **API**: trigger on demand by sending an HTTP POST to a per-routine endpoint with a bearer token
* **GitHub**: run automatically in response to repository events such as pull requests or releases

A single routine can combine triggers. For example, a PR review routine can run nightly, trigger from a deploy script, and also react to every new PR.

Routines are available on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans with [Claude Code on the web](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) enabled. Create and manage them at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines), or from the CLI with `/schedule`.

Team and Enterprise Owners can disable routines for all members with the Routines toggle at [claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code). When disabled, existing routines stop running and members cannot create new ones.

This page covers creating a routine, configuring each trigger type, managing runs, and how usage limits apply.

## Example use cases

Each example pairs a trigger type with the kind of work routines are suited to: unattended, repeatable, and tied to a clear outcome.

**Backlog maintenance.** A schedule trigger runs every weeknight against your issue tracker via a connector. The routine reads issues opened since the last run, applies labels, assigns owners based on the area of code referenced, and posts a summary to Slack so the team starts the day with a groomed queue.

**Alert triage.** Your monitoring tool calls the routine's API endpoint when an error threshold is crossed, passing the alert body as `text`. The routine's prompt tells Claude to investigate the alert in the fire payload, so it pulls the stack trace, correlates it with recent commits in the repository, and opens a draft pull request with a proposed fix and a link back to the alert. On-call reviews the PR instead of starting from a blank terminal.

**Bespoke code review.** A GitHub trigger runs on `pull_request.opened`. The routine applies your team's own review checklist, leaves inline comments for security, performance, and style issues, and adds a summary comment so human reviewers can focus on design instead of mechanical checks.

**Deploy verification.** Your CD pipeline calls the routine's API endpoint after each production deploy. The routine runs smoke checks against the new build, scans error logs for regressions, and posts a go or no-go to the release channel before the deploy window closes.

**Docs drift.** A schedule trigger runs weekly. The routine scans merged PRs since the last run, flags documentation that references changed APIs, and opens update PRs against the docs repository for an editor to review.

**Library port.** A GitHub trigger runs on `pull_request.closed` filtered to merged PRs in one SDK repository. The routine ports the change to a parallel SDK in another language and opens a matching PR, keeping the two libraries in step without a human re-implementing each change.

The sections below walk through creating a routine and configuring each of these trigger types.

## Create a routine

Create a routine from the web at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines), from the Desktop app, or from the CLI. All three surfaces write to the same cloud account, so a routine you create in one shows up in the others immediately. In the Desktop app, click **Routines** in the sidebar, then **New routine**, and choose **Remote**; choosing **Local** instead creates a [Desktop scheduled task](/docs/en/desktop-scheduled-tasks), which runs on your machine rather than in the cloud.

The creation form sets up the routine's prompt, repositories, environment, connectors, and triggers.

Routines run autonomously as full Claude Code cloud sessions: there is no permission-mode picker and no approval prompts during a run. The session can run shell commands, use [skills](/docs/en/skills) committed to the cloned repository, and call any connectors you include. What a routine can reach is determined by the repositories you select and their branch-push setting, the [environment's](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#the-cloud-environment) network access and variables, and the connectors you include. Scope each of those to what the routine actually needs.

Routines belong to your individual claude.ai account. They are not shared with teammates, and they count against your account's daily run allowance. Anything a routine does through your connected GitHub identity or connectors appears as you: commits and pull requests carry your GitHub user, and Slack messages, Linear tickets, or other connector actions use your linked accounts for those services.

### Create from the web

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the creation form">
    Visit [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines) and click **New routine**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name the routine and write the prompt">
    Give the routine a descriptive name and write the prompt Claude runs each time. The prompt is the most important part: the routine runs autonomously, so the prompt must be self-contained and explicit about what to do and what success looks like.

    When a trigger fires, the session receives the routine's saved prompt as its assigned task and carries it out, rather than treating it as untrusted content that arrived mid-conversation. The trigger attests only that the prompt was stored ahead of time by an authorized session on your account, so the fired prompt is not live user input and can't act as approval or consent for actions during the run. Content the session fetches during the run keeps its normal handling. {/* min-version: 2.1.214 */}Before v2.1.214, the session received the same prompt framed as an untrusted background notification and could refuse to act on it.

    The prompt input includes a model selector. Claude uses the selected model on every run.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select repositories">
    Add one or more GitHub repositories for Claude to work in. Each repository is cloned at the start of a run, starting from the default branch. Claude creates `claude/`-prefixed branches for its changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select an environment">
    Pick a [cloud environment](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#the-cloud-environment) for the routine. Environments control what the cloud session has access to:

    * **Network access**: set the level of internet access available during each run
    * **Environment variables**: provide API keys, tokens, or other secrets Claude can use
    * **Setup script**: install dependencies and tools the routine needs. The result is [cached](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#environment-caching), so the script doesn't re-run on every session

    A **Default** environment is provided with **Trusted** network access, which allows the [default set](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#default-allowed-domains) of package registries, cloud provider APIs, container registries, and common development domains, but blocks everything else. If your routine needs to reach your own services or a domain outside that list, edit the environment's [network access](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#network-access) before running. To use a separate environment, [create one](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#configure-your-environment) first.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a trigger">
    Under **Select a trigger**, choose how the routine starts. You can pick one trigger type or combine several.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Schedule">
        Pick a preset frequency for a recurring run, or schedule a single one-off run at a specific timestamp. See [Add a schedule trigger](#add-a-schedule-trigger) for timezone handling, stagger, custom cron intervals, and one-off runs.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="GitHub event">
        Select the repository, the event to react to, and optional filters. See [Add a GitHub trigger](#add-a-github-trigger) for the full list of supported events and filter fields.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="API">
        Select **API** here, then save the routine. The URL and token are generated after the routine is saved, since they depend on the routine ID. See [Add an API trigger](#add-an-api-trigger) to copy the URL and generate a token.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review connectors and permissions">
    The **Connectors** and **Permissions** tabs at the bottom of the form control what the routine can reach.

    Under Connectors, all of your connected [MCP connectors](/docs/en/mcp) are included by default. Remove any the routine doesn't need. Claude can use every tool from an included connector, including writes, without asking for permission during a run.

    Under Permissions, enable **Allow unrestricted branch pushes** for any repository where Claude should be able to push to existing branches instead of only `claude/`-prefixed ones.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the routine">
    Click **Create**. The routine appears in the list and runs the next time one of its triggers matches. To start a run immediately, click **Run now** on the routine's detail page.

    Each run creates a new session alongside your other sessions, where you can see what Claude did, review changes, and create a pull request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create from the CLI

Run `/schedule` in any session to create a scheduled routine conversationally. You can also pass a description directly, for a recurring routine like `/schedule daily PR review at 9am` or a one-off like `/schedule clean up feature flag in one week`. Claude walks through the same information the web form collects, then saves the routine to your account. The command is also available under the alias `/routines`.

A successful start looks like a conversation: Claude asks follow-up questions about the schedule, repositories, and prompt before saving. If Claude instead replies that you need to authenticate or that it can't connect to your remote claude.ai account, no routine was created; see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

`/schedule` in the CLI creates scheduled routines only. To add an API or GitHub trigger, edit the routine on the web at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines).

The CLI also supports managing existing routines. Run `/schedule list` to see all routines, `/schedule update` to change one, or `/schedule run` to trigger it immediately.

A routine with no schedule trigger, such as one started only by API calls or GitHub events, has no next run time, and the CLI shows none when Claude saves or updates it. Before v2.1.211, the CLI reported a next run time in the year 1 for these routines.

## Configure triggers

A routine starts when one of its triggers matches. You can attach any combination of schedule, API, and GitHub triggers to the same routine, and add or remove them at any time from the **Select a trigger** section of the routine's edit form.

### Add a schedule trigger

A schedule trigger runs the routine on a recurring cadence, or once at a specific future time. Pick a preset frequency in the **Select a trigger** section: hourly, daily, weekdays, or weekly. Times are entered in your local zone and converted automatically, so the routine runs at that wall-clock time regardless of where the cloud infrastructure is located.

Runs may start a few minutes after the scheduled time due to stagger. The offset is consistent for each routine.

For a custom interval such as every two hours or the first of each month, pick the closest preset in the form, then run `/schedule update` in the CLI to set a specific cron expression. The minimum interval is one hour; expressions that run more frequently are rejected.

#### Schedule a one-off run

A one-off schedule fires the routine a single time at a specific timestamp. Use it to remind yourself later in the week, to open a cleanup PR after a rollout finishes, or to kick off a follow-up task when an upstream change lands. After the routine fires, it auto-disables and the web UI marks it as **Ran**. To run it again, edit the routine and set a new one-off time.

<Note>
  One-off scheduling from the CLI is rolling out gradually and may not be available on your account yet. If `/schedule` only offers recurring schedules, create the one-off run from the web at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines) instead.
</Note>

Create a one-off run from the CLI by describing the time in natural language. Claude resolves the phrase against the current time and confirms the absolute timestamp before saving.

```text theme={null}
/schedule tomorrow at 9am, summarize yesterday's merged PRs
```

```text theme={null}
/schedule in 2 weeks, open a cleanup PR that removes the feature flag
```

The same local-to-UTC conversion as recurring schedules applies to one-off timestamps.

One-off runs do not count against the daily routine run cap. They consume your plan's regular subscription usage like any other session. See [Usage and limits](#usage-and-limits) for details.

### Add an API trigger

An API trigger gives a routine a dedicated HTTP endpoint. POSTing to the endpoint with the routine's bearer token starts a new session and returns a session URL. Use this to wire Claude Code into alerting systems, deploy pipelines, internal tools, or anywhere you can make an authenticated HTTP request.

API triggers are added to an existing routine from the web. The CLI cannot currently create or revoke tokens.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the routine for editing">
    Go to [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines), click the routine you want to trigger via API, then click the pencil icon to open **Edit routine**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an API trigger">
    Scroll to the **Select a trigger** section below the **Instructions** box, click **Add another trigger**, and choose **API**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the URL and generate a token">
    The modal shows the URL for this routine along with a sample curl command. Copy the URL, then click **Generate token** and copy the token immediately. The token is shown once and cannot be retrieved later, so store it somewhere secure such as your alerting tool's secret store.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Call the endpoint">
    Send the token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header when you POST to the URL. The [Trigger a routine](#trigger-a-routine) section below shows a complete example.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each routine has its own token, scoped to triggering that routine only. To rotate or revoke it, return to the same modal and click **Regenerate** or **Revoke**.

#### Trigger a routine

Send a POST request to the `/fire` endpoint with the bearer token in the `Authorization` header. The request body accepts an optional `text` field for run-specific context such as an alert body or a failing log, passed to the routine alongside its saved prompt. The value is freeform text and is not parsed: if you send JSON or another structured payload, the routine receives it as a literal string.

The `text` value doesn't reach the routine as a bare message. It arrives wrapped in a `<routine-fire-payload>` block that labels it as untrusted data and tells Claude not to follow instructions inside it unless the routine's own prompt says to. The same wrapping applies to text supplied with **Run now** in the web UI.

This means a routine's saved prompt must opt in to acting on fire text: write the prompt to reference the payload explicitly, for example "Investigate the alert described in the routine-fire-payload block", or the routine treats the text as inert context. Anyone holding the bearer token can send `text`, so the wrapper makes fire text from a leaked token arrive labeled as untrusted data rather than as direct instructions to your routine.

The example below triggers a routine from a shell. The routine ID and token shown are placeholders: replace them with the URL and token you copied when [adding the API trigger](#add-an-api-trigger), or the request fails with a `401` authentication error:

```bash theme={null}
curl -X POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/claude_code/routines/trig_01ABCDEFGHJKLMNOPQRSTUVW/fire \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-ant-oat01-xxxxx" \
  -H "anthropic-beta: experimental-cc-routine-2026-04-01" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Sentry alert SEN-4521 fired in prod. Stack trace attached."}'
```

A successful request returns a JSON body with the new session ID and URL:

```json theme={null}
{
  "type": "routine_fire",
  "claude_code_session_id": "session_01HJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
  "claude_code_session_url": "https://claude.ai/code/session_01HJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
}
```

Open the session URL in a browser to watch the run in real time, review changes, or continue the conversation manually.

<Warning>
  The `/fire` endpoint ships under the `experimental-cc-routine-2026-04-01` beta header. Request and response shapes, rate limits, and token semantics may change while the feature is in research preview. Breaking changes ship behind new dated beta header versions, and the two most recent previous header versions continue to work so that callers have time to migrate.
</Warning>

#### API reference

For the full API reference, including all error responses, validation rules, and field limits, see [Trigger a routine via API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/claude-code/routines-fire) in the Claude Platform documentation.

The `/fire` endpoint is available to claude.ai users only and is not part of the Claude Platform API surface.

### Add a GitHub trigger

A GitHub trigger starts a new session automatically when a matching event occurs on a connected repository. Each matching event starts its own session.

<Note>
  During the research preview, GitHub webhook events are subject to per-routine and per-account hourly caps. Events beyond the limit are dropped until the window resets. See your current limits at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines).
</Note>

GitHub triggers are configured from the web UI only.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the routine for editing">
    Go to [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines), click the routine, then click the pencil icon to open **Edit routine**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a GitHub event trigger">
    Scroll to the **Select a trigger** section, click **Add another trigger**, and choose **GitHub event**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Claude GitHub App">
    The Claude GitHub App must be installed on the repository you want to subscribe to. The trigger setup prompts you to install it if it isn't already.

    <Note>
      Running `/web-setup` in the CLI grants repository access for cloning, but it does not install the Claude GitHub App and does not enable webhook delivery. GitHub triggers require installing the Claude GitHub App, which the trigger setup prompts you to do.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the trigger">
    Select the repository, choose an event from the [supported events](#supported-events) list, and optionally add filters. Save the trigger.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Supported events

GitHub triggers can subscribe to either of the following event categories. Within each category you can pick a specific action, such as `pull_request.opened`, or react to all actions in the category.

| Event        | Triggers when                                                                 |
| :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pull request | A PR is opened, closed, assigned, labeled, synchronized, or otherwise updated |
| Release      | A release is created, published, edited, or deleted                           |

#### Filter pull requests

Use filters to narrow which pull requests start a new session. All filter conditions must match for the routine to trigger. The available filter fields are:

| Filter      | Matches                          |
| :---------- | :------------------------------- |
| Author      | PR author's GitHub username      |
| Title       | PR title text                    |
| Body        | PR description text              |
| Base branch | Branch the PR targets            |
| Head branch | Branch the PR comes from         |
| Labels      | Labels applied to the PR         |
| Is draft    | Whether the PR is in draft state |
| Is merged   | Whether the PR has been merged   |

Each filter pairs a field with an operator: equals, contains, starts with, is one of, is not one of, or matches regex.

The `matches regex` operator tests the entire field value, not a substring within it. To match any title containing `hotfix`, write `.*hotfix.*`. Without the surrounding `.*`, the filter matches only a title that is exactly `hotfix` with nothing before or after. For literal substring matching without regex syntax, use the `contains` operator instead.

A few example filter combinations:

* **Auth module review**: base branch `main`, head branch contains `auth-provider`. Sends any PR that touches authentication to a focused reviewer.
* **Ready-for-review only**: is draft is `false`. Skips drafts so the routine only runs when the PR is ready for review.
* **Label-gated backport**: labels include `needs-backport`. Triggers a port-to-another-branch routine only when a maintainer tags the PR.

#### How sessions map to events

Each matching GitHub event starts a new session. Session reuse across events is not available for GitHub-triggered routines, so two PR updates produce two independent sessions.

## Manage routines

Click a routine in the list to open its detail page. The detail page shows the routine's repositories, connectors, prompt, schedule, API tokens, GitHub triggers, and a list of past runs.

### View and interact with runs

Click any run to open it as a full session. From there you can see what Claude did, review changes, create a pull request, or continue the conversation. Each run session works like any other session: use the dropdown menu next to the session title to rename, archive, or delete it.

<Note>
  A green status in the run list means the session started and exited without an infrastructure error. It does not mean the task in your prompt succeeded. Open the run to read the transcript and confirm what Claude actually did. Blocked network requests, missing connector tools, and task-level failures all surface there rather than in the status indicator.
</Note>

### Edit and control routines

From the routine detail page you can:

* Click **Run now** to start a run immediately without waiting for the next scheduled time. You can optionally supply run-specific text, which reaches the routine the same way as the API trigger's `text` field.
* Use the toggle in the **Repeats** section to pause or resume the schedule. Paused routines keep their configuration but don't run until you re-enable them.
* Click the pencil icon to open **Edit routine** and change the name, prompt, repositories, environment, connectors, or any of the routine's triggers. The **Select a trigger** section is where you add or remove schedules, API tokens, and GitHub event triggers.
* Click the delete icon to remove the routine. Past sessions created by the routine remain in your session list.

### Repositories and branch permissions

Routines need GitHub access to clone repositories. When you create a routine from the CLI with `/schedule`, Claude checks whether your account has GitHub connected and prompts you to run `/web-setup` if it doesn't. See [GitHub authentication options](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#github-authentication-options) for the two ways to grant access.

Each repository you add is cloned on every run. Claude starts from the repository's default branch unless your prompt specifies otherwise.

By default, Claude can only push to branches prefixed with `claude/`. This prevents routines from accidentally modifying protected or long-lived branches. To remove this restriction for a specific repository, enable **Allow unrestricted branch pushes** for that repository when creating or editing the routine.

### Connectors

Routines can use your connected MCP connectors to read from and write to external services during each run. For example, a routine that triages support requests might read from a Slack channel and create issues in Linear.

Connectors are the [claude.ai integrations](/docs/en/mcp#use-mcp-servers-from-claude-ai) on your account. MCP servers you added locally in the CLI with `claude mcp add` are stored on your machine rather than your claude.ai account, so they do not appear in the connectors list. To use one of those servers in a routine, add it as a connector at [claude.ai/customize/connectors](https://claude.ai/customize/connectors), or declare it in a committed [`.mcp.json`](/docs/en/mcp#project-scope) so it is part of the cloned repository.

When you create a routine, all of your currently connected connectors are included by default. Remove any that aren't needed to limit which tools Claude has access to during the run. You can also add connectors directly from the routine form.

To manage or add connectors outside of the routine form, visit [claude.ai/customize/connectors](https://claude.ai/customize/connectors) or use `/schedule update` in the CLI.

### Environments and network access

Each routine runs in a [cloud environment](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#the-cloud-environment) that controls network access, environment variables, and setup scripts. The routine inherits the environment's network policy on every run.

The **Default** environment uses **Trusted** network access: the [default allowlist](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#default-allowed-domains) of package registries, cloud provider APIs, container registries, and common development domains is reachable, but arbitrary domains are not. Outbound requests to other hosts fail with `403` and `x-deny-reason: host_not_allowed`. MCP connector traffic is routed through Anthropic's servers, so the connectors you add to the routine work without adding their hosts to **Allowed domains**. Remove any connectors you don't need under [Connectors](#connectors).

To allow additional domains:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the routine for editing">
    On the routine's detail page, click the pencil icon to open **Edit routine**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the environment selector">
    Below the **Instructions** box, select the cloud icon showing your environment's name, such as **Default**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the environment settings">
    Hover over the environment in the list and click the settings icon that appears on the right.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change the network access level">
    In the **Update cloud environment** dialog, change **Network access** to **Custom** and enter your domains in **Allowed domains**. Check **Also include default list of common package managers** to keep the [default allowlist](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#default-allowed-domains) alongside your custom domains. Select **Full** instead for unrestricted access.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save changes**. The new policy applies from the next run.
  </Step>
</Steps>

See [Network access](/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#network-access) for details on access levels and the default allowlist.

## Usage and limits

Routines draw down subscription usage the same way interactive sessions do. In addition to the standard subscription limits, routines have a daily cap on how many runs can start per account. See your current consumption and remaining daily routine runs at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines) or [claude.ai/settings/usage](https://claude.ai/settings/usage).

When a routine hits the daily cap or your subscription usage limit, organizations with usage credits turned on can keep running routines on metered overage. Without usage credits, additional runs are rejected until the window resets. Turn on usage credits at [claude.ai/settings/usage](https://claude.ai/settings/usage). On Team and Enterprise plans, an admin turns them on for the organization at [claude.ai/admin-settings/usage](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/usage).

One-off runs do not count against the daily routine cap. They draw down your regular subscription usage like any other session, but they are exempt from the per-account daily routine run allowance.

## Troubleshooting

### `/schedule` returns "Unknown command"

The CLI hides `/schedule` when one of its requirements isn't met: the command menu shows `No commands match "/schedule"` while you type, and submitting it returns `Unknown command: /schedule`. The cause is usually one of the following:

* You are authenticated with a Console API key or a cloud provider such as Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud's Agent Platform, or Microsoft Foundry. `/schedule` requires a claude.ai subscription login. If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` is set in your shell, or `apiKeyHelper` is set in `settings.json`, remove it first, since these take precedence over a claude.ai login
* `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`, or `DISABLE_GROWTHBOOK` is set in your shell environment or in the `env` block of a [`settings.json` file](/docs/en/settings#available-settings). These disable feature-flag fetching, which `/schedule` depends on
* You are inside a Claude Code on the web session. Manage routines from the [web UI](https://claude.ai/code/routines) instead

You can always create and manage routines at [claude.ai/code/routines](https://claude.ai/code/routines) regardless of how the CLI is configured.

### `/schedule` asks you to authenticate

If `/schedule` runs but Claude responds that you need to authenticate with a claude.ai account first, the CLI has no stored claude.ai login. API accounts aren't supported for routines. Run `/login`, sign in with your claude.ai account, then run `/schedule` again.

### "Routines are disabled by your organization's policy"

An Owner in your Team or Enterprise organization has likely turned off the **Routines** toggle at [claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/claude-code). This is a server-side organization setting, so it cannot be overridden from your local configuration. Ask an Owner to enable routines for your organization.
