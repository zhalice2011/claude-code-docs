# Enterprise network configuration

> Configure Claude Code for enterprise environments with proxy servers, custom Certificate Authorities (CA), and mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication.

Claude Code supports various enterprise network and security configurations through environment variables. This includes routing traffic through corporate proxy servers, trusting custom Certificate Authorities (CA), and authenticating with mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) certificates for enhanced security.

<Note>
  All environment variables shown on this page can also be configured in [`settings.json`](/en/settings).
</Note>

## Proxy configuration

### Environment variables

Claude Code respects standard proxy environment variables:

```bash theme={null}
# HTTPS proxy (recommended)
export HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com:8080

# HTTP proxy (if HTTPS not available)
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Bypass proxy for specific requests - space-separated format
export NO_PROXY="localhost 192.168.1.1 example.com .example.com"
# Bypass proxy for specific requests - comma-separated format
export NO_PROXY="localhost,192.168.1.1,example.com,.example.com"
# Bypass proxy for all requests
export NO_PROXY="*"
```

<Note>
  Claude Code does not support SOCKS proxies.
</Note>

### Basic authentication

If your proxy requires basic authentication, include credentials in the proxy URL:

```bash theme={null}
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
```

<Warning>
  Avoid hardcoding passwords in scripts. Use environment variables or secure credential storage instead.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  For proxies requiring advanced authentication (NTLM, Kerberos, etc.), consider using an LLM Gateway service that supports your authentication method.
</Tip>

## CA certificate store

By default, Claude Code trusts both its bundled Mozilla CA certificates and your operating system's certificate store. Reading the OS store requires a runtime with `tls.getCACertificates`: the native installer always has it, and npm installs need Node 22.15 or later. On older Node versions, only the bundled set and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` apply. Enterprise TLS-inspection proxies such as CrowdStrike Falcon and Zscaler work without additional configuration when their root certificate is installed in the OS trust store and the runtime can read it.

`CLAUDE_CODE_CERT_STORE` accepts a comma-separated list of sources. Recognized values are `bundled` for the Mozilla CA set shipped with Claude Code and `system` for the operating system trust store. The default is `bundled,system`.

To trust only the bundled Mozilla CA set:

```bash theme={null}
export CLAUDE_CODE_CERT_STORE=bundled
```

To trust only the OS certificate store:

```bash theme={null}
export CLAUDE_CODE_CERT_STORE=system
```

<Note>
  `CLAUDE_CODE_CERT_STORE` has no dedicated `settings.json` schema key. Set it via the `env` block in `~/.claude/settings.json` or directly in the process environment.
</Note>

## Custom CA certificates

If your enterprise environment uses a custom CA, configure Claude Code to trust it directly:

```bash theme={null}
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/path/to/ca-cert.pem
```

## mTLS authentication

For enterprise environments requiring client certificate authentication:

```bash theme={null}
# Client certificate for authentication
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_CERT=/path/to/client-cert.pem

# Client private key
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY=/path/to/client-key.pem

# Optional: Passphrase for encrypted private key
export CLAUDE_CODE_CLIENT_KEY_PASSPHRASE="your-passphrase"
```

Claude Code reads the certificate and key files at startup and re-reads them each time it applies settings, including when settings change during a session. To rotate the certificate and key, replace the files at the same paths.

## Network access requirements

Claude Code requires access to the following URLs. Allowlist these in your proxy configuration and firewall rules, especially in containerized or restricted network environments.

| URL                            | Required for                                                                                                                                                                                 |

If you install Claude Code through npm or manage your own binary distribution, end users may not need access to `downloads.claude.ai` or `storage.googleapis.com`.

Claude Code also sends optional operational telemetry by default, which you can disable with environment variables. See [Telemetry services](/en/data-usage#telemetry-services) for how to disable it before finalizing your allowlist.

When using [Amazon Bedrock](/en/amazon-bedrock), [Google Cloud's Agent Platform](/en/google-vertex-ai), [Microsoft Foundry](/en/microsoft-foundry), or a signed-in [Claude apps gateway](/en/claude-apps-gateway) session, model traffic and authentication go to your provider or gateway instead of `api.anthropic.com`, `claude.ai`, or `platform.claude.com`. The WebFetch tool still calls `api.anthropic.com` for its [domain safety check](/en/data-usage#webfetch-domain-safety-check) unless you set `skipWebFetchPreflight: true` in [settings](/en/settings).

[Claude Code on the web](/en/claude-code-on-the-web) and [Code Review](/en/code-review) connect to your repositories from Anthropic-managed infrastructure. If your GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization restricts access by IP address, enable [IP allow list inheritance for installed GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#allowing-access-by-github-apps). The Claude GitHub App registers its IP ranges, so enabling this setting allows access without manual configuration. To [add the ranges to your allow list manually](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization#adding-an-allowed-ip-address) instead, or to configure other firewalls, see the [Anthropic API IP addresses](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/ip-addresses).

For self-hosted [GitHub Enterprise Server](/en/github-enterprise-server) instances behind a firewall, allowlist the same [Anthropic API IP addresses](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/ip-addresses) so Anthropic infrastructure can reach your GHES host to clone repositories and post review comments.
